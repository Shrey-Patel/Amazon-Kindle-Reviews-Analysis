The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.\n\nYleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.\n\nFor the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.", "Feedback": "negative"}

{"ReviewerID": "A1I2O9Y3X3HXLS", "ProductID": "B000FA65EK", "Review": "The Fury of a Woman Scorned Hades' Daughter is the first novel in the Troy Game series.  Millennia ago, during the late Bronze Age, the king of Athens was forced to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete every nine years.  There they were left in the dark maze of the Labyrinth to become victims of Asterion, the Minotaur son of the Minoan king.  One year, the Athenian king sent Theseus, his own son, to Crete among the sacrificial levy.  Theseus gained the love of the Minoan king's daughter, Ariadne, slayed Asterion and escaped with the other captives, Ariadne, and her younger sister Phaedra.\nNow Ariadne was pregnant with a daughter by Theseus and he had become infatuated with Phaedra.  So Theseus abandoned Ariadne and his unborn daughter on the island of Naxos, saying that it would be too dangerous for her to sail on and that he would return from Athens after the child was born to take them to his home.  When Ariadne objected, Theseus claimed that he was only doing the will of the gods and sailed off with his his paramour to Athens.  In her anger, Ariadne plotted vengeance against the entire Aegean world, gods as well as men, and used her powers as Mistress of the Labyrinth to initiate the destruction of all the labyrinths except one.  Since these labyrinths had been used to magically trap all manner of evil influences to protect their cities, corruption and destruction soon began to spread throughout the Aegean.\nAfter launching her curse, Ariadne sailed away from Naxos to the far distant island of Albion.  In the following years, disaster after catastrophe destroyed cities and crops and lives throughout the Aegean as the labyrinths failed.  Finally, the Aegean world was wracked by the ten year Trojan War, spreading Trojan refugees throughout the known world.\nIn this novel, 98 years after the fall of Troy, the Trojan Kingman Brutus, son of Silvius and heir of Aeneas, is visited by the seeming of the goddess Artemis and told that he is destined to build Troia Nova on the island of Albion.  First, however, he must complete a task to prove his worthiness.\nCornelia is a fifteen year old dreamer who has decided on a certain youth as her future husband.  When this youth is slain by Brutus and then Brutus takes her in marriage by force of arms, Cornelia screams her hatred and starts to plot against the Trojans.  When that plot and other efforts to oppose Brutus fail disastrously, Cornelia blames herself for the lost lives and her spirit is broken.\nIn this story, the Trojans sail to Llangarlia on Albion as victims of a great scheme by the great-great-granddaughter of Ariadne to reconstruct the Game (or labyrinth) of Troy upon the Veiled Hills above the banks of the River Llan.  She is the only surviving Mistress of the labyrinth and Brutus is the only surviving Kingman.  Together the two can rebuild the Trojan Game and Brutus will sacrifice almost anything to gain that power.  Strangely, however, he can't quite sacrifice Cornelia.\nThis story is rich in ancient Greek and British allusions and nuances.  The many details of ordinary life in those societies make the tale convincing and immediate.  One finds oneself vicariously living among these characters and participating in their lives.\nThe story nicely weaves the myth of the Minotaur with other Greek and British myths.  The author tells us why and how the Aegean world self-destructed.  Moreover, she tells you the real story of the city of Llanbank on Albion.  Just when you thought you knew the truth, this novel comes along to confuse you once more.\nThe story does include some rather explicit sex and sexual cravings.  Moreover, the relationship between Brutus and Cornelia has more than a hint of sado-masochism, but may be fairly typical of those brutish times. This relationship is nicely contrasted with such bonds within the matriarchial Llangarlian society.\nThis novel does move somewhat slowly at first.  One is almost tempted to look ahead to see how it will come out.  Moreover, the author has interspersed scenes from pre-war London prior to the Blitz to further tantalize the reader.  Just when the story is beginning to really move, however, it terminates;  although it will be continued in God's Concubine, one hates to wait.\nRecommended for Douglass fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of ancient societies and magic.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A1JV4QKTEB7QBL", "ProductID": "B000FA65EK", "Review": "\"Des\" Troy Game Luckily, I listened to this book while I exercised rather than read it and found that Douglass's straightforward uncomplicated literary style directly complimented the mindless activity I strove to accomplish.  This is not to say that I thought the book uninteresting or boring in any way.  On the contrary, the storyline moves along, albeit the pre-historical plotline jars pathetically with the author's modern jargon leaving the reader no choice but to roll one's eyes upward in utter amazement at the blatant inconsistency.\n\nIn a nutshell, the plot revolves around a somewhat undefined 'game' at which a labyrinth plays an integral part in protecting the city in which it is located.  With the anger of a spurned woman, Ariadne of Crete beseiges her half-man half-bull brother Asterion to teach her the dark ways that will help her destroy the power of the labyrinth after Theseus throws her over for her younger sister.  Of course, as mistress of the labyrinth, she leaves a backdoor for herself and her female progeny--a way in which to recreate the game in a future time and reclaim her power.  Approximately 100 years later, Ariadne's heir Genvesa is all but ready, however she needs a King man to help her dance the mystical powers of the game back into being and forever trap Asterion in the center of the maze.  Trojan Brutus, adept at the game, is her man and through a series of ploys and adventures, Genvesa lures him from Greece to the misty land of Albion--the southern portion of the British Isles.  One crucial problem arises to snag Genvesa's plans when Brutus impulsively takes Cornelia, the daughter of a conquered king, as his wife and drags her along on his quest for the promised land of New Troy. In Albion, Genvesa has all but destroyed the old god and goddess that ruled the island.  When the Albion mother goddess, Mag, Genvesa's chief foe, hides within Cornelia, Genvesa's plans to reconstruct the game are almost permanently foiled.\n\nAs you can imagine, this tale is long and fraught with the machinations of all characters who seek either self-preservation or the heady power of pure domination.  Douglass cleverly combines many myths to support her premise and to bring alive the baser natures of her creations.  However trite, there is sex, gore and raw emotion galore, so much so that I found myself wincing with disgust at many of the too descriptive passages enlightening the reader to scenes of birth, death and utter savagery.  The characters seem to be intentionally crafted as archetypes like the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece rather than real fleshed out personas. Brutus lives only for the power of kingship and possession of Genvesa.  Cornelia, raped and torn from her family and country, somehow improbably forgets her grief and yearns for love from her brutal husband.  Genvesa connives with a hallowe'en witch's malevolence while the rest of the cast are simply not finely drawn enough to not be categorized as either good or evil.  All characters are either blighted with trite dialogue or overly long-winded emotional explosions.\n\nBottom line:  While the story will keep your attention, none of the characters are subtle enough to capture your emotions; they are stylized shadows which at times fail to elicit much response other than a shrug and a turn of the page.  The literary style fails to recreate a feel for ancient times, rather it attributes modern day sensibilities to otherwise primordial savages.  I don't know if I will read the second volume of this trilogy unless I could again listen to it while I engaged in something physically challenging.", "Feedback": "negative"}

Also a victim is Etna Bliss, visiting niece of a fellow professor. Assisting her and her aunt home, the usual staid and controlled Nicholas is so smitten, he courts and asks Etna to marry him. She turns him down. He's distraught. Startled and flattered by his reaction, Etna accepts his proposal for she can't believe a man could love her so. Thus the love affair is one-sided from the beginning.\n\nThe marriage goes on an even keel with Nicholas accepting that Etna has less passion for him than he for her. They have two children. She throws herself into volunteer work. Then he discovers she has purchased a cottage and has been going there on days he thought she was doing charity work. Etna's excuse is that she wishes a refuge, a place to escape from her everyday life for a while but Nicholas refuses to believe it.  When a visiting professor from Yale is discovered to be the brother of a man Etna had a love affair with when she was younger, and is also in the running to be named Dean at Thrupps, a position Nicholas covets, his jealousy erupts. Philip Asher and Etna renew their friendship, making Nicholas view the younger man as a competitor for his wife's affection, and the fact that Asher is a Jew makes the insult greater.\n\nForcing his teenage daughter to be his accomplice, Nicholas formulates a plan to rid himself of his rival, both from his wife's life and the position at the college...\n\nThe story, with its overtones of racial prejudice, are told in flashback as Nicholas makes a train journey to Florida, showing too late the extent of his guilt and his love, as well as his repentance for what he has done.\n\nWhile Nicholas' obsession with Etna isn't the bloodthirsty, murderous kind, it still has enough of a hold that even thirty years later, when the story is told, his passion, so tightly controlled except on this one subject, still breaks through. It is the story of a man not expecting to find such a burning emotion for a woman, allowing it to secretly influence him to such an extent that he'll ruin an innocent man's reputation to get her back.\n\nNicholas succeeds in his attempt but fails at the same time for his victory is a bitter one.

She keeps writing about people who love the wrong people, marry for the wrong reasons and cannot communicate with one another.\n\nThough immensely fast paced and readable, I did not like this first person account. It is told as a memoir that is written while the protagonist is on a train some 30 years later. It takes a great deal of time to learn that Nicholas Van Tassel, a pompous professor at a \"Dartmouth-like\" college in New England, falls for Etna Bliss, a repressed woman, who has secrets of her own.  After their marriage, Bliss submits to her husband, but never participates in the joinings.  Van Tassel is unable to discuss any of this with her and this, of course, leads to the Shreve's \"big conclusion.\"\n\nVan Tassel is a small minded, midling professor who is jealous of other men, particularly another professor brought in to compete with Van Tassel for a school position.

The story takes place in the early 1900's, and begins with a restaurant fire. The narrator had been eating in the hotel restaurant when the fire broke, and he relates to the event and his first glimpse of the woman who will eventually become his wife. What is important is the narration, as it gives the reader a very good observation of the character of this person, Nicholas Van Tassel, who will come across to most as learned, somewhat pompous and at times arrogant. His speech is, I felt, over the top, and this is what gives one the impression that he often times feels he's above everyone else (which is implied, not stated).\n\nHe is immediately besotted with this beautiful woman, who is a little past marriageable age but nevertheless attracts his attention. He cannot stop thinking about her. He finds a way to meet her, and learns that she is the niece of a colleague of his at Thrupp College, where he himself is also a professor. Her parents are deceased, so she is currently living with her uncle Professor Bliss until she is ready to return home to what is now has become her brother in law's house  (being a woman, she had no rights to the property where she had lived with her parents. Thus she was kicked out of her own house).\n\nNicholas begins to woo Etna, coming to see her at her uncle's house and asking to take walks with her. The courtship is slow and long, and Etna (the reader will notice) is not enamored with Nicholas as he is with her. Eventually, Nicholas gets the courage to ask for her hand in marriage, and Etna does accept eventually, as it is the better of two evils - she knows that her fate was to live the life of a spinster, becoming the nanny to her sister's children.\n\nThus begins the life of Nicholas and Etna Bliss, with Etna agreeing to be the mother of his children, to be his wife. They have two children and to the outside world all seems to be perfect. But the marriage was lacking in one important factor - Etna did not love Nicholas, and Nicholas knows this. He hopes that as the years progress that his wife will learn to love him as much as he passionately loves her.\n\nThe reader will know immediately that Nicholas's love for Etna is not a healthy one. He is obsessed with her, as is evidenced by his thoughts throughout the narration, and his actions. Etna is trapped in a marriage she never wanted, but felt she had to accept because she needed stability and a place to call her own. What Nicholas does not know for quite a while is that Etna is keeping secrets. And Etna does her best to keep them hidden, as they are the only sources of happiness she has in this one-sided marriage.\n\nI wasn't sure if I would like ALL HE EVER WANTED, being somewhat skeptical with the male narration, but it worked for me. Shreve creates a character that the reader will loathe, or maybe feel pity for, but I certainly had strong feelings towards this man who I felt was a chauvinist and a pompous jerk. But was he a result of the times? Maybe. Still, the life he and Etna create together is far from perfect, and I could certainly understand Etna's needs. Anita Shreve does it again, and has written another absorbing novel in ALL HE EVER WANTED.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I found this book so unsatisfying that I vowed to never read another Shreve work.  But an aunt encouraged me to read All He Ever Wanted and I was floored by this beautifully written and hauntingly tragic story.\n\nAll He Ever Wanted is written in the first person through the eyes of Nicholas Van Tassel.  Starting in 1899, Van Tassel is a professor of history at Thrupp--a small college in a small New Hampshire town of the same name.  Van Tassel is eating dinner at the Thrupp Hotel when a fire breaks out.  He gives aid to a number of other patrons, and is immediately smitten by the lovely Etna Bliss.  Van Tassel embarks on a crusade to win the hand of Etna. While he's passionately in love with Miss Bliss, she shares a fondness for the professor that falls short of love.\n\nI can't divulge more about the plot without giving it away.  But let me say it is a book that will haunt you with questions and what ifs.  Is it possible to be happy with someone knowing that they don't love you?  It is possible to love someone too much?  How does love and passion turn into a dangerous obsession?  What is the difference between love and ownership?  And how is it that obsessive love can drive intelligent people to do rash, stupid, unethical and even illegal things (consider the recent case of astronaut Lisa Nowak)? You will continue thinking about this book long after you've finished.\n\nShreve writes beautifully in All He Ever Wanted, though it is in the style of the Victorian era with lots of flourishes and embellishments.  Van Tassel describes his courtship period as \"They were as well days of great turbulence of the heart, of unparalleled joy of the spirit,  and of a thrill within the blood such as I had never known before.\"  The prose reminds me of Geraldine Brooks, author of both Year of Wonders and March.  As a physical education teacher, I had to especially chuckle at Van Tassel's efforts to keep physical education out of Thrupp College.  \"To give a degree to students whose chief occupation for four years has been employing wood-and-iron dumbbells in rhythmic motions or running circles in a gymnasium, all the while yelling like Rebels, is nothing short of absurd.\"  Unfortunately, such flowery writing will not appeal to all readers.\n\nI am glad that I gave Anita Shreve another chance and will be more willing to read her other books after finishing All He Ever Wanted.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I have thoroughly enjoyed Shreve's writings in the past and this book, while very well-written, is disturbing, and quite frankly, the characters in this book have a tendency to be very irritating. It starts off simply ~~ there's a hotel fire while Nicholas, the main character, was having his dinner. A professor at the local college, he was just enjoying his meal when a fireball bursts through the restaurant. Once outside, he finds himself enthralled with a young woman who was taking care of a young girl and an older woman. That woman eventually became his wife, Etna. Etna has made it clear from the beginning that she does not love Nicholas and she probably never will.\n\nThis is a darker book than I suspected ~~ a book of passion, betrayal and loss. This is a book where a man finds himself in despair and drove his wife away and broke up a very happy little home because he couldn't control his jealousy. It is an uncomfortable book where the reader finds out that one person in this marriage loves the other more than anything in this world, but it's not a beautiful thing to watch since it was a possessive love. (The whole time I was reading this book, I kept thinking, thank goodness that I am not the one married to this guy!)\n\nAt the same time while I was being appalled, I was also compelled to keep reading to the bitter end. It is very well-written and interesting enough to the end.

While taking into account that the story is told from Nicholas' point of view, if he is to be believed, Etna was a cold, stand-offish woman, who never should have married this man.  While she was a product of her time, and there were woman who had no choice but to marry men they did not love, she, on the other hand seemed to have options.

The narrator of the story (who is recounting his past while en route to his sister's funeral) bachelor Nicholas Van Tassel, a stuffy professor at a snotty boys' school, is inside the hotel when the blaze begins but leaves unscathed.  During this tragedy where twenty people perish in a fiery death he meets the woman of his dreams, Etna Bliss.\nEtna's \"handsome\" face, her lovely waist and her other womanly attributes haunt his every thought.  Even her name, Bliss, brings lusty thoughts to his mind (and starts my skin to crawling).  His infatuation is all consuming and before long he begins to pursue her with all of the gusto of a starving dog drooling over a choice bit of meat.  She eventually agrees to a date where he learns, a bit to his dismay, that she has a brain as well as fine breasts and is surprisingly literate.  They read stories together and seem to get along well but when he makes a move or turns the conversation towards the personal she immediately gives him the cold shoulder.  I should add that Nicholas is described as the most un-athletic man on earth with a slight paunch and a balding pate.  The sexual attraction seems entirely one-sided and a bit creepy.  At this point I would've put the book aside unfinished as I found Nicholas Van Tassel boring beyond belief and far too pompous.  However, since I was listening to this in its unabridged format and I was stuck in traffic I continued to torture myself with Nicholas Van Tassel's words (expertly read by a narrator who reads in a purposely haughty way).\nDespite the fact that Etna does not return his feelings of undying love he insists that they marry and, oddly enough, she agrees!  Thus begins their awkward life together.  During their years of marriage they parent two children (and, thakfully, we are spared the oogey details of their sterile love making ~ thank you Mr. Van Tassel for speedily skipping by those bits and saving me a few shudders!) and seem to get along decently enough as they plod along through their days.  Nicholas gives Etna a nice life and the freedom to do whatever she wishes but sadly the love Nicholas aches for is never returned by Etna.  Nicholas, the poor love starved sap, is grateful just to have her for his wife and doesn't complain about her complete lack of affection towards him.  But things begin to change when he discovers that Etna has been hiding things from him.  This is where the book finally picked up and actually engaged my full attention.\nAt this point Nicholas *almost* becomes a sympathetic character if you can believe it (though he is still a thoroughly unpleasant fellow)!  He is riddled with insecurities and although he has been married to a woman he cherishes for years he will never be a happy or successful man.  His world begins to spiral out of control as he simultaneously discovers Etna's been keeping secrets and learns the position he's been longing to have at the University may be forever out of his reach.\nNicholas's festering jealously and over-reaction to Etna's secret (which was odd but not nearly as devastatingly earth-shattering as I'd anticipated), however, ruin any smidgen of pity I may have felt for him just a few chapters earlier.  Author Shreve successfully paints an unpleasant picture of a thoroughly unpleasant man caught up in a situation of his own making.  Reading Nicolas Van Tassel's vitriolic comments and actions for pages on end was a depressing experience that I won't be repeating any time soon!", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Even her lesser efforts tend to leave the reader gasping for air at the end--and \"All He Ever Wanted,\" one of her best, in my opinion, is breathtaking in the same shocking way.\nWritten entirely from the point of view of a stodgy male college professor circa 1900, this is the story of a passion so intense, so unlike the writer himself, that it is scarcely believable, especially when related in the stilted flowery language of the day.\nNicholas Van Tassel, a rather ordinary pedantic with nothing particularly unusual about him, happens to be in a hotel restaurant when it catches fire. This single pivotal episode in his otherwise unremarkable life changes him forever--it is during the rescue effort that he encounters Miss Etna Bliss, and falls head over heels into a passion that borders on, indeed IS, an obsession.\nHampered by the extreme rules of etiquette governing proper men and women of the day, Van Tassel nevertheless pursues Miss Bliss, finally persuading her to marry him despite her the fact that, as she honestly tells him, she does not love him. Love will come, thinks Van Tassel, hardly able to believe his luck in winning his prize. And that hope, that fantasy, that overwhelming obsession of his entire being, eventually destroys the narrator, his wife, and his entire family.\nShreve stays in character completely and thoroughly, managing to evoke the failings of the man himself, the restrictions of the society in which he lives, and the hopelessness of his obsession without ever once betraying herself. It is safe to say that the author stays well in the background while letting Van Tassel tell his own tragic story.\nI consider this book a minor masterpiece.

Like Fortune's Rocks and Sea Glass, All He Ever Wanted by Anita Shreve is a book filled with wonderful characters set against a historical background of social mores and traditions.  And as she did in he previous historical novels, the author offers her readers a wonderful novel and one that left me wishing for another book by Anita Shreve.\nAll He Ever Wanted begins during a fire when Nicholas Van Tassel, a professor at a small college in New Hampshire, spots a young woman and accompanies her home that evening.  Almost immediately Nicholas becomes besotted with the woman Ms. Etna Bliss and begins courting her.  From this point of the narrative, Shreve moves the scene to a time many years later as Nicholas recounts the story of his love for Etna on a train as he is bound for his sister's funeral in Florida.  At this point Shreve becomes almost a modern day Edith Wharton as through Nicholas we come to learn about his views of society in the early 1900's through 1930.  As readers, we watch as Nicholas becomes further obsessed with Etna, thwarts a rival for a competitive position at the college and eventually comes under scrutiny for a transgression he did many years before. And as these events are taking place we also watch as Nicholas' and Etna's relationship begins to spiral out of control and wonder how this will all be resolved.  For in the end all Nicholas ever wanted is the love of Etna.\nI highly recommend this book to those readers who have enjoyed Anita Shreve in the past and for those who may want to read her for the first time.  The author has a wonderful ability to put her readers right between the pages of the book.  In addition the narrative evokes the language and society of the 1900's.

Maybe the changes will be welcomed and cherished. Maybe they will be full of regret and despair. Or maybe it will be a life filled with moments of both, making the memories bittersweet.\nProfessor Nicholas Van Tassel of Thrupp College has experienced just such an event. Up to that particular moment in his life, he didn't realize he was missing anything.\nHowever, when a fire in a hotel restaurant propels Van Tassel out into the cold, he happens to look up and see a striking woman standing across the street. An instant obsession forms on his part and for him she will become the thing he must have, no matter what it will cost him.\nThe narration of this story actually takes place sixty-four years after it begins in December 1899. Van Tassel is traveling to his sister's funeral and is afforded much time to ponder the events which have unfolded since he met Etna Bliss, the woman who would be the cause of his greatest joy...and grief.\nCircumstances have brought him to a point where he feels it necessary to provide an explanation to his son. This he will do via a journal that chronicles the years shared with Etna and the emotions brought on by them (sprinkled with a bit of hindsight commentary and other present-day notations).\nVan Tassel's writing will serve more than just the intended purpose. It will also offer him the opportunity to purge his soul of his lifelong obsession.\nAnita Shreve's account of one man's fixation on fully possessing a woman he can never truly know, understand or be loved by is fraught with passion, perfidy and pain.\nIt is told in the first person, so even the reader is never privy to what happens in the mind of Etna Bliss. This can become frustrating at times when introduced to a mysterious incident in Etna's past, which so wholly affects her present and future life with Van Tassel. The reader experiences a need to know which remains unfulfilled except for the explanation formed only in the imagination of Van Tassel based on his own similar, yet more desperate, need to know.\nAn overconfident reader will not enjoy the book based on a preconceived idea that the outcome is obvious. One should refrain from making assumptions based on what seems like blatant foreshadowing and simply absorb the story as it is being written by Professor Van Tassel. Some of the strived-for emotional reactions will be missed otherwise.\nRead without supposition, All He Ever Wanted will do more than provide a short escape from reality into the world of fiction.

In \"All He Ever Wanted,\" Shreve writes from the point of view of a man, Nicholas Van Tassel, who is a college teacher in a small New Hampshire town in 1899. Van Tassel, by chance, encounters a young woman with the unlikely name of Etna Bliss, and he is immediately smitten with her. Van Tassel refuses to listen when Etna insists that she can never reciprocate his love, and he asks her to marry him. This decision will come back to haunt him.\nShreve chose unwisely when she decided to write the book from Nicholas's point of view. He is a pompous, selfish, and shortsighted individual, who for much of the book is blind to his own shortcomings. He makes an unreliable and irritating narrator. The author should have told the book from Etna's point of view, for she is by far the most interesting character in the book. We learn little about Etna's inner life, and what we learn is told from Nicholas's skewed viewpoint.\nWe do find out that Etna has a secret and tumultuous past, one that she chooses not to share with her husband. Nicholas, who is a pompous chauvinist, does not sympathize with his wife and his clumsy efforts to control her behavior inevitably backfire. Shreve's narrative style is occasionally heavy-handed and overwrought in this novel, and her lack of subtlety weakens the book.\nWhat keeps me interested in reading Shreve's novels is her compassion for her characters. Both Nicholas and Etna are stuck in certain roles, and neither one is flexible enough to change. Since these two individuals are so different from one another, and so lacking in any understanding of one another's needs, their relationship can only bring heartbreak. Anita Shreve has always been an expert at expressing the sorrow of unhappily married couples.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Anita Shreve just can't seem to write a bad book.\nIn All He Ever Wanted, her tale concerns unrequited love, the results of the somewhat unlikely 'love at first sight.' Maybe this was more commn in the early 20th century, the era in which this book is set, but it was the only part of the tale that stretched my credulity. The story covers a lot of ground: anti-Semitism, ... abuse, women's rights, and academia.\nIf you liked Shreves' other books, you won't be disappointed by this one.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2F6N60Z96CAJI", "ProductID": "B000FA671Q", "Review": "Shreve once again proves her place as a bestselling author Now in his senior years, Nicholas Van Tassel travels on a train from New England to Florida for the burial of his sister, while writing the memoirs of his ruined life. He begins years earlier with the fire --- the fire that would set his fate.\nAs crowds escape a hotel blaze, Van Tassel spots a riveting woman under a lamppost. \"There was about her a quality of stillness that was undeniably arresting, and if I close my eyes now,\" he recalls, \"here in this racketing compartment, I can travel back in time more than three decades and see her unmoving form amidst the nearly hysterical crowd.\" From the start, Shreve sets up the initial sighting of Etna Bliss as something beyond normal attraction. Van Tassel tells us \"my desire for this unknown woman was so immediate and keen and inappropriate that it quite startled me.\" In hindsight, Van Tassel describes his passion as capable of eroding and enhancing character --- in equal measure --- and yet it is the sentence about erosion that is most telling of things to come: \"The erosion the result of the willingness to do whatever is necessary to obtain the object of one's desire, even if it means engaging in lies or deception or debasing what was once treasured.\"\nEnamored, Van Tassel pursues the aloof Etna immediately and with vigor. He ingratiates his way into her life, which is easy to do in the small quiet town where he has made his life and where there is little else to entertain or distract Etna. A seemingly harmless type --- professorial by vocation and character --- he is, by his own account, loyal and disciplined, even, ironically, when visiting the less savory neighborhood of Springfield, Massachusetts for trysts with women of some reputation. Etna proves to be a formidable mystery, but Van Tassel, who is obsessed, perseveres. They ultimately wed and have children, but Etna remains distant and impenetrable, and Van Tassel suspects that she has known love before him, though he dare not ask. Instead, he lets his jealousy fester. Eventually Etna's past comes to light and collides with Van Tassel's need to totally possess her. A grand scale betrayal ensues, wreaking destruction and devastation on all involved.\nShreve peppers the story with the telltale detail she has come to be known for. Set in the last 19th and early 20th centuries, Van Tassel and Ms. Bliss engage in a proper courtship of afternoon teas, walks in the park and the exchange of books. All the while Van Tassel's desire grows, consumes and seethes below the surface.\nShreve is one of those rare great authors who is equally at ease writing about any period. One sees the clothes, the furniture and the architecture in lively, captivating detail. Even in sharing his want, Shreve shows the reserve appropriate of the time: \"Had it been at all within the realm of possibility, I would have crossed the distance between us and forced her face to mine. I would have dug my hand into the small of her back so that she was pressed hard against me. I would have lifted her skirts and run my hand along her thigh and tucked my fingers into her stocking. I would have done all those things, and perhaps she saw this, for she drew herself together in an instant, as if she had plunged her wrists into icy water. Of course, I did nothing, but I cannot help but wonder what might have happened between us had I been bold enough to touch her then.\" Such restraint is palpably evident throughout the book --- and rightly so. It is the tenor of the time and Shreve is a master of time.\nThe acclaimed talents evident in WEIGHT OF WATER, THE PILOT'S WIFE and Shreve's other works are on full display in ALL HE EVER WANTED. She takes us to another time period with evocative language, in a rich and complex story. Shreve plumbs the depth of desire and love and jealousy in intimate and immediate detail, once again proving her place as a bestselling author.\n  --- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2MF2QVSCUI27G", "ProductID": "B000FA671Q", "Review": "When addiction masquerades as \"love\" On a lone journey by rail, having now lived many years alone and reflecting on his past, Nicholas Van Tassel begins a memoir of his marriage from 1899 to 1915. The archaic prose, the style of the last century, is the first hint to the reader that this tale begins in another time and place. Restricted by Victorian mores, Van Tassel's manner is inhibited and constrained by the particular social customs and strict codes of conscience of the era. Any mention of sexuality is forbidden to Victorians in mixed company and women are protected from life's crude realities, their sensitivities wrapped in a diaphanous cloak of romanticism. Men may be men, with base carnal appetites, but women must remain unsullied, their virginity preserved for marriage. Even then, it is unacceptable for a woman to express any carnal physical needs; a woman's duty is to bear and raise children, creating a nurturing and comfortable home. It is the dawn of a new Century and the world is full of amazing inventions and conveniences, the future brimming with promise. Nicholas Van Tassel, Professor of Literature and Rhetoric at a small New England college, is, at thirty, self-effacing and modestly aware of his shortcomings, not quite handsome and not quite brilliant. One evening when a fire breaks out in the restaurant where he is dining, senses heightened in the moment of incipient danger, Van Tassel notices a particular young woman. From that moment on, he is obsessed with her, unable to find peace until he has captured her attentions. Van Tassel sets his mind to the courtship and marriage of Etna Bliss, sensing that her circumstances are not advantageous enough for her to refuse his suit. He is unable to withstand the compulsion of his desire, aware that Etna does not return his affection, yet undaunted. Etna clearly declares that she does not love Nicholas before she accepts his affections and agrees to the marriage. Like the typical Victorian romantic, Van Tassel is sure Etna will come to love him in time. True to form, he stubbornly denies all semblance of reality, save his own unquenchable needs.\nShreve's protagonist advances from his first insufferable demeanor of propriety, over time, to the reality of his true nature, a base man whose self-importance is so consuming that he is incapable of empathy for another human being. When he marries Etna, Van Tassel knows the bargain does not include her love. By accepting less from his spouse, he, in fact, extracts his pound of flesh, chipping away at the marriage's meager foundation. Bit by intrusive bit, Nicholas suffocates the beleaguered Etna. For her part, Etna has signed her own pact with the devil, never imaging the enormous price she will be asked to pay.\nThe true nature of obsession is not denied or veiled with romanticism in order to make it bearable. Stripping this particular emotion of any appeal, Shreve acknowledges the truth: deluded by ego into despicable actions, demanding that fate bend to his will with astounding hubris, Van Tassel is unworthy even of the reader's sympathy. The failings he so freely claims are actually conceits, his excuse to blindly pursue his own fulfillment, sublimating all else. Unflinching in the face of such a distortion of love, Shreve pens a story of true obsession without guile or artifice, an obsession as craven and venal as any of the Seven Deadly Sins.

{"ReviewerID": "A3SZMGJMV0G16C", "ProductID": "B000FA64PK", "Review": "Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.\n\nWe start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.\n\nIn fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.\n\nCertainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

The problem with a con man is you never know what's real and what's not. In the book, that didn't particularly bother me. I was looking for a good story, not a true story. Where the book failed me was in the end. It rushed to a conclusion where Mr Abagnale turns from a life of deception to a life devoted to unmasking the deceivers. The conversion is not convincing. In fact, I doubt that there was one. Mr Abagnale's role of FBI consultant is simply another role from a man who looks at life as a series of roles. Thing of it is, his viewpoint might actually be the correct one for a world where alternative facts mandate alternative realities. What makes his story so interesting is the ease with which he moved from one identity to the next based on his innate skill at fabricating the right set of credentials for a given audience.

Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.\n\nThere's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.\n\nUnlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book \"A Forest Apart\" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.\n\nThe story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.\n\n***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***\n\n First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.\n\nMy only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid \"IT\" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a \"distraction.\"  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.\n\n***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***\n\nOkay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

{"ReviewerID": "A1S68JYEXNETRR", "ProductID": "B000FBFMHU", "Review": "A Globetrotting Story of Adventure Like many, I came to this book after having seen the Steven Spielberg movie, eager to hear the story as told by the REAL Frank Abagnale Jr.  I was both pleased and startled by the differences from the movie in this book, but enjoyed the casual and rather frank way Abagnale Jr related his crimes.\n\nNo doubt about it: Abagnale was uniquely a product of his time.  While it's entertaining to read his unbelievably brash exploits, one has to remember that most of his crimes took place during the late 50s through the early 70s, long before the Internet, centralized crime databases, ACH systems, or any of the anti-terrorism banking policies existed.  As such, most of what occurs in this book would be all but impossible to pull off today.  Still, a lafge part of Abagnale's success also came from his inflappable confidence, keen eyes, sharp wit, and a little luck.  One key thing his narrative makes clear: the weakest link in any security system is a gullible person, and just acting like you're doing what you're supposed to be doing often dupes people.\n\nThe actual narration of the story is quite enjoyable.  While anyone under the age of 40 (such as myself) might not get even half the slang terms and idioms, and while Abagnale has one hell of an advanced vocabulary, his style is easy going, charming, and logical.  Oftentimes, the boom reads less like an autobiography (which it really isn't) and more like a very simple first person novel.\n\nAnd despite the fact that Abagnale is a shameless womanizer (a fact he makes clear throughout the book) and scammed hundreds of businesses in dozens of countires out of millions of dollars, you can't but help like him.  He seemed to have had a code (he only ever bilked businesses, not individuals ... save for one greedy prostitute), and didn't ever USE anyone per se ... just deceived them.  In fact, even during his years long crime spree, he tried several times to find love, repaid several debts with cash (not fake checks), and regretted some of his actions.\n\nNow, for those wondering, the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr differs from the movie in a number of different ways; in an interview excerpt,  he himself says it is about \"eighty percent accurate\".  In general the movie cut out a lot of time scale, played up the influence his parents had on his initial entrance into crime, reduced the severity of his prison time in France (in a word: torture), and most disappointing, Tom Hanks's character didn't really exist.  In fact, Abagnale states he didn't even meet the FBI agent that had been pursuing him until years later, and the agent had no reason to like him.  In fact, that's part of the reason for my 4 star review; while I understand that reality can sometimes be more boring than fiction, Abagnale's narration is, nonetheless, sometimes less captivating.  In addition, the heavy use of dated slang and sometimes confusing explanations play into the rating.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful and entertaining read that's also a bit enlightening, at times emotional, and always vicarious.", "Feedback": "positive"}

It is such a fun book to read.  I just finished another reading of it.  There are a lot of things in the book I had forgotten.

Abagnale is quick to admit that his primary motivation for getting into the check-scamming business (which began as a small time bit of credit-card fraud) was getting tail. But if life is unfair to women in this book, it's just as unfair to criminals, business-people, and ultimately to Frank Abagnale.\n\nIn fact, \"life's not fair\" is a recurring theme, provided that you accept \"unfairness\" as equal parts favorable and unfavorable. Abagnale's early escapades are fueled as much by unbelievably good luck as they are by his unflappable charm, bravado, and guile. While his primary scam involved being a pilot who didn't have to fly, he also stumbled into three legitimate jobs--albiet on false credentials--first as a doctor who didn't have to practice medicine, then as a lawyer who didn't have to practice law, and finally as a professor who DID have to teach, but who didn't have to know the material especially well. But his fortune would soon change, as at the end of his five year crime spree, he couldn't hole up anywhere in the US or Europe without being recognized. Then his luck gets even worse.\n\nAbagnale's recounting of his nightmarish stint in a French prison almost redeemed the nonchalance of his playboy lawlessness. And make no mistake, this is a book of self-aggrandizement. Despite that, it is a highly addictive read--Abagnale is as charming on paper as he must have been in person. You can't help but smile at some of the stunts he gets away with, although I was mortified at his tenure as a pediatrician (that may just be the new father in me). Still, for all the womanizing and bamboozling, CMIYC is the story of a dumb kid who was too smart for his own good, who started a scam as a lark but found himself painted into a corner with no way out but to keep going before he finally hit bottom. While his antics are infuriating, you still want to cheer him on.\n\nA note on the Kindle edition: it's a tad overpriced, given its length.

I enjoyed the movie based on this book so I hoped the book would be better. Although the book certainly provided more information about the scams and how he got away with it, Abagnale himself was much less charming in the book. He was too much of a womanizer and a...well...con-man. Emotions weren't expressed (other than relief at escaping one or another of his women), making it difficult to empathize with him. Also, the adult Abagnale (who took part in writing the book) didn't seem to feel much remorse about his activities. He rationalized: \"I never conned a square John out of money,\" but ignores the emotional strain that he must have put on many of his victims. Also, I am a little skeptical of the \"true\" part of this \"true crime\" story. I believe that the basic idea is true, but there were just too many convenient coincidences for his story to be entirely accurate. He must have taken bits and pieces of different escapades and pasted them together into a unified story, and over-emphasized his own cleverness.

But at the end I wondered, how much of this is true?\n\nWikipedia doesn't have a definitive answer:\n\n\"The authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits were questioned even before the publishing of Catch Me If You Can. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that 'Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.'\n\n\"In 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness rather vaguely with a statement posted on his company's website. The statement said in part 'I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.'\"\n\nSo I recommend the reader enjoy the story as historical fiction. Even if half his exploits in the book are true, it's still an astonishing tale of the expert con.  More importantly to me, I can see how in everyday life--in the workplace, politicians, etc--the confidant talker always gets ahead of the shyer guy or gal who actually knows what the heck is going on.  The USA at this time suffers from a crisis of leadership at all levels in all arenas, as we the people rush to follow the smooth talkers, ignoring the quiet facts.", "Feedback": "positive"}

It's no surprise that he quickly overspends and his account is overdrawn.  Instead of facing the problem, he runs away from it.  His similarity to other teens ends here.\n\nBecause he looks ten years older than his true age, Frank is able to pass as an adult.

His quick wits keep him a few steps ahead of the FBI as he also impersonates a doctor, a lawyer--even on occasion an FBI agent.

If you liked the movie version of this semi-autographical breeze of a read, you certainly will enjoy Frank Abagnale Jr's madcap recap of a scant few years of his life starting when he was barely sixteen.  Endowed at an early age with a power physique and an attitude to match, Frank has no difficulty in getting people, especially \"foxy\" women to believe that he is ten years older.  He blames his short life of crime on a perpetual case of spring fever-where ample loads of cash are needed to fuel this heavenly fire.  A modern day P.T. Barnum, Frank gives his audience what they crave, cashing bogus checks that he becomes more adept at making as time goes on, while embarking on a spree of impersonations that range from doctor, lawyer, airplane co-pilot to university professor.  Even with the full knowledge that crime doesn't pay, the reader cannot help but cheer Frank on as he \"dead-heads\" his way across the country and eventually around the world.  As his descriptions of his stay in a French prison makes you wonder if any of this free-loading was worthwhile, we commiserate with his dread of being prosecuted by every country in Europe and are pleased when he finally serves his time in the US and actually escapes.  Unlike the movie, the book devotes little time to the FBI agent who shares the cinematic spotlight or to the actual dynamics of Frank's family life.  In fact, only in the book's afterward is Abagnale's actual present day career of check-fraud expert even mentioned.\n\nRecommended to all those who want to shake their heads in wonder at teenaged audacity.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Some of it is verifiable, but Abagnale was, in many cases, the only one there. He fabricated so much of his existence, knowing when it is the truth and when it is storytelling is impossible.

However, just like Murphy, Abagnale is a man whose life is redeemed. The book doesn't cover this.\n\nThere is something oddly heroic about a guy who has managed to fool a lot of people just by pretending. While applauding Abagnale's crimes are wrong, his ingenuity is amazing. He was good enough for the government to cut a deal with him. That's Tom Sawyer with more pluck and style.

At the age of sixteen he manages to forge a pilot's license and \"deadhead\" his way around the country bouncing checks. He also passes himself off as an pediatrician, a college professor, and an assistant district attorney. The last is probably his most impressive exploit, as he passes the bar exam (on his third try) with only two years of high school.\n  After years of exploiting the gullibility of bank tellers and airline clerks, Abagnale is finally captured in France, where he spends six hellacious months in a Devil's Island of a prison. He is then transferred to a Swedish prison, a one hundred and eighty degrees difference, more like a college dorm than a prison. He could've spent the rest of his life being handed from one European penal system to another, some of them vying for brutality with France, but he is saved by a Swedish judge who extradites him to the U.S. Back home, he escapes from apprehension at the airport and from prison later, embarrassing the F.B.I. and his nemesis agent O'Reilly. But, by then, just about every law enforcement official in America is on the lookout for him. He is ultimately captured and does four years jail time, only to emerge once more smelling like a rose. After a few years bouncing around doing such scut work as managing a grocery store and a pizza joint, he convinces a bank manager to let him give a lecture to his employees on how to spot a \"paperhanger.\" From there, he's referred to another bank and another and so on. These days he teaches at the F.B.I Academy.\n  There is a brief question and answer section at the end of the book in which Abagnale decries the leniency of our American penal system; surprisingly, he prefers the French method, which reminded me a lot of the dungeons in THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO. Also, don't expect to see much of Agent O'Reilly.

In a nutshell, as a teenager and young man in the 1960s he passed himself off as a respectable professional (usually a Pan Am pilot) for the purposes of cashing bogus checks and living large off the results. It gets old reading about how he refined his scam this way or that and then partied with yet another lovely \"fox\" in this or that city. The book is more interesting when he passes himself in other professions (pediatrician, lawyer, sociology professor) and actually manages to bluff his way through actually practicing them for a short time. It's a testament to how anyone with good looks, an air of confidence in what they're doing, a keen sense of observation, and a bit of research can bluff their way through life, although it should be noted that many of his scams would not be nearly so easy in our contemporary world of computer record keeping and instantaneous data transfer. The veracity of his tale is hard to measure, certainly the whole books reeks of exaggeration, but the basic scams sound entirely plausible--whether he was able to pull them off as often or as easily as he makes out is hard to say.\nHis after-the-fact self justifications mixed with his constant reminders that he only fleeced corporations, not honest individuals quickly get annoying. Abagnale does not write with a great deal of introspection either, he seems to have no motive for his crimes other than financing a luxurious lifestyle and getting his kicks. He never examines why he's driven in that way, although he obliquely blames his initial con jobs on the need to have extra cash to woo women properly. Women are perhaps the real losers in his cons, as he bounces from conquest to conquest in his attempt to live out some teenage fantasy, he breaks at least one heart that he tells of and likely many others. The result: \"My dalliances, by and large, had all the permanency of rabbits' relationships, and about the same degree of satisfaction.\"\nThe book would have benefited from an interweaving of the story of his persuit by the FBI (which is alluded to here and there, but never really fleshed out), and his ultimate transformation from criminal to FBI consultant.

{"ReviewerID": "A3TO3AY1UFM83U", "ProductID": "B000FBFM1G", "Review": "Short Stories by Raymond Chandler If you've read one or more of Raymond Chandler's novels, the stories collected under the title The Simple Art of Murder are pretty much what you'd expect, for which I am grateful.  I don't know that Chandler ever used the term noir fiction to characterize his work, but I'm a fan of the noir genre, as I understand it, and Chandler was one of the first to produce novels and short stories that merit the noir designation.\n\nWhether in novels like The Big Sleep or Farewell, My Lovely, or stories such as those included in The Simple Art of Murder, the noir world, truth be told, is much like our own.  Hypocrisy, duplicity, vanity, ruthless self-seeking, official corruption, and cruelty, with or without a purpose, are the stuff of which the noir context is made.  Genuine decency, unselfish kindness, generosity, and untainted love are hard to find and commonly devalued as just so much softness.\n\nChandler's noir protagonists understand all this, and they accept it grudgingly, knowingly, ironically, and often tempered with more alcohol than most of us could handle.  None of Chandler's protagonists, whether his signature character Phillip Marlowe or one of the lesser lights who stand in for Marlowe in some of his stories, has an iron-clad claim to sainthood.  They're sharp dressing chain-smokers who, whatever their unhealthy habits, are well put together, at ease with women, and know how to handle themselves in tough situations.\n\nNevertheless, while Chandler's protagonists, all detectives of one kind or another, are not clean-living do-gooders, they are imbued with a fundamental integrity, a moral sense that enables them to live as imperfect people in a pretty rotten world without needlessly hurting anyone for fun and profit.  They value humaneness, good-heartedness, and unselfishness when they find these qualities, and they have a keen but understated appreciation for people who are decent and kind.  They can distinguish the usurious malefactors from ordinary folks who have stumbled into trouble and don't know how to get out, and they are inclined to give the latter sort a break, even if it means giving a pass to someone who in a formal-legal sense is guilty of a crime.  Lesser characters than a Chandler protagonist would not develop friendly feelings for a guy like Henry Eichelberger, forthcoming thief that he is.\n\nWhether they go by the name Phillip Marlowe, Johnny Dalmas, Walter Gage, or Pete Anglich, the foregoing is a reasonable typification of Chandler's protagonists.  This may lead some to surmise that Chandler's stories are pretty much the same.  However, while the noir fictional form and the ideal-typical noir protagonist are Chandler's stock in trade, his novels and stories are enormously varied.  Readers of The Simple Art of Murder will learn that murder, whether or not it's really simple, takes many forms, committed by a broad range of people for a wide variety of reasons using methods that, in some creative instances, I'm pretty sure that no one but Chandler ever thought of.\n\nChandler, moreover, is a master of detail.  His vivid and informed descriptions of people, clothing, furniture, public buildings, flower gardens, tropical fish, homes of the rich and hovels of the poor are beyond the capabilities of most authors, whatever their genre.  On occasion I think that Chandler gives us more detail than we really need, and it may be presented in a vaguely formulaic manner.  However, his ability to so completely and persuasively describe the physical settings of noir fiction adds interest and realism to his stories.  Chandler, without question, was as intelligent and cultivated as authors of more prestigious genres.  Chandler graphically describes the lives and locations of characters from the broad spectrum of social levels in ways that suggest that what he couldn't get through conventional means, from books, he got through planned and unplanned first-hand encounters.  One doesn't get as knowledgeable as Chandler without, from time to time, playing the role of ethnographer of noir.\n\nIn truth, Chandler was a literary intellectual of the best sort.  How many other authors appreciate \"sustaining E above high C for an almost incredible period of time,\" especially when it comes out of a trumpet blown by a guy they know to be dissipated, self-absorbed, and an abuser of unsuspecting and vulnerable women?  How many other authors would know how to remove white fungus from the frayed fin of a gold fish without harming the fish?  How many could call to mind the geographical uniqueness of Puget Sound.\n\nThese are among the countless observations that Chandler works into his stories to give his characters substance and realism.  I agree that there are times when the flurry of details is so dense that we may temporarily lose the thread of the story, especially since the stories are often complex.  Nevertheless, on balance, Chandler's determination to show us the richly particularized world in which his noir fiction is set contributes substantially to its interest and enables the reader to better understand what is going on.\n\nAt the outset, I was inclined to think of the stories in The Simple Art of Murder as exercises that Chandler used to prepare for writing his Phillip Marlowe novels.  However, each of the stories stands alone, complete and distinctive, and in my experience they deserve to be read one at a time, then allowed to sink in before going to the next one.  However, you take them, we see Raymond Chandler at work, producing high quality noir with intellectual integrity and a particularly insightful take on the human condition.  It's not pretty or uplifting, but we can always count on his protagonists, cynical but not thoroughly jaded, to show us something worth caring about.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Fiction has always tried to be realistic, but tastes change (perceptions of reality). Detective stories often outsell the best-sellers of yesteryear (perhaps because the situations they describe are always current, even if the language and costumes change). Chandler contrasts the writings of Hammett and others to the classic post-WW One fiction (which is usually contained in the houses of the rich and powerful). Chandler lists the problems with A.A. Milne's \"The Red House Mystery\". They are too contrived, and disregard life in the real world. The realism of Hammett (and others) is how they describe the world that is seldom reported in your daily newspaper, except obliquely (\"Zoning Board Adopts Changes\"). This essay offers wisdom and an overview of detective stories.\n\n \"Pearls Are A Nuisance\" reads like a satire on detective stories. Walter represents the classic wealthy detective of English fiction, Henry the hard-boiled detective of American fiction. They try to recover a stolen pearl necklace, which is \"Dutch\" (slang for fake). But a high ransom tells Walter they are real. Walter recovers the pearls in a surprise ending.\n\n \"Spanish Blood\" starts with the murder of a political opponent. A detective is assigned to search the murdered man's country cabin - and finds a dead body! Sam finds an informer and speaks to him before he is shot. Sam follows this lead, but winds up captured. Sam's speech leads to more dead bodies, and the case is now closed. The last pages present the shocking surprise ending.\n\n \"The King in Yellow\" begins with a musician waking up the whole floor in a hotel. The \"night clerk\" tosses him out; but the musician knows the owner, so Steve is canned. Steve looks up an address, and finds the first body. He meets more people, and finds more bodies. When he returns to the hotel, an old killing is brought up. Following this clue leads to the murderers, and the old scandal that caused them.\n\n \"I'll Be Waiting\" is about one-night's events at a hotel. A woman checks in and tells the night clerk she's waiting for a visitor. The porter tells Tony that a stranger wants to see him (a warning about another guest).

All of this sordid and grim yarns include murder, slugging matches, taut dialogue and low life types.\n  You probably won't remember the convoluted plots but you will marvel at Chandler's ability  to word pain the contents of a room; draw a Dickensian picture of a character in a few short lines and savor the ambience of decadent Los Angeles from the 1930s to post World War II. Rivers of alcohol are consumed in the stories; Chandler was himself a notorious alcoholic cutting down on his literary output and his screenwriting work for Hollywood.\nThe stories in this collection were culled from pulp fiction periodicals Chandler wrote for to keep the money coming into his home.\n  The Preface to the collectionis the much admired Chandlerian essay on \"The Simple Art of Murder\" in which he discusses the art of the crime story.\n  The more you read Chandler the more you will enjoy his mastery of the English language as it is spoken in the United States. Chandler makes ample use of metaphors, similies, slang and tough guy argot. Read him and relish the genius of the City of Angels chronicler of crime!", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A1UMVK332GJ0PO", "ProductID": "B000FBFM1G", "Review": "classic essay, historical shorts The Simple Art Of Murder is worth reading for the eponymous essay, first published in 1944, which opens the book.  It describes the shift in the genre of detective fiction from the neat-and-tidy society popularized by Agatha Christie or even Arthur Canon Doyle to the grittier, darker world mastered by Dashiell Hammett and later embraced by Raymond Chandler.\n\nThe works in this compilation are obviously classics of the genre, and were the stepping stones on which Chandler developed his style which was later used in his more famous works, the novels featuring Philip Marlowe.  However, despite that each story on its own, featured in its time as a magazine publication, may have been a success, the compilation is less successful.  With the notable exception of \"Pearls are a Nuisance\", an obvious parody of the characters of Christie's time, and \"I'll be Waiting\", a moody piece which is also substantially the shortest in the collection, the stories here tend to blend together.\n\nNone of the works is really a classic mystery in the sense the reader could intuit the outcome.  Instead, the stories focus on the dark, tough-guy sphere of the Los Angeles underworld.  Virtually everyone over the age of 18 smokes, drinks, and carries a gun, and there's nobody under 18.  Eventually a reader gets the view poking a loaded gun into someone's chest was the canonical salutatory gesture of the early 1930's, only later replaced by the handshake.  And it's slightly disturbing how the racism of the time is embedded into virtually all of the stories here.\n\nThe strength of the works is Chandler's descriptive prose, which quickly captures the dark mood he's obviously after.  In particular, he opens his stories strongly, sucking the reader in with the first paragraph.  So if you forget about the weaknesses in plot, allowing yourself to instead be captured in the moment of the writing, this book will be more enjoyable.\n\nTo be fair to Chandler, these stories weren't intended to be thus bundled.  So for the opening essay, and for the historical niche the stores fill, I give this one 4 stars.  However, I certainly owe Chandler the respect of reading one of his full-length novels before passing judgement on his merits.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Chandler's estate is getting money; God's in his heaven; all's right with the world.\n\nOnce in a while you do wish Amazon was a little less slapdash, and looked over ebook publishers' shoulders a little bit more. So far the Tom Corbett series, complete with illustrations, is the most lovingly presented ebook I've seen, better than this Chandler and far better than the Oxford Complete Shakespeare.\n\nAlso the business of mixing the Kindle reviews with other reviews is confusing.\n\nThis collection of short stories leads off with one essay, Chandler's most famous, \"The Simple Art of Murder.\" That's the one where he badmouths all traditional Golden Age detective stories, and dissects A. A. Milne's THE RED HOUSE MYSTERY in about three closely reasoned pages.

Chandler effectively stopped writing short stories (again, except for \"The Pencil\") after his first novel, THE BIG SLEEP, in 1939. Some of his later short stories resembled the novels to come, and their heroes were sometimes renamed Philip Marlowe in later reprintings, for example in THE BEST AMERICAN MYSTERY STORIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY's version of \"Red Wind.\"\n\nThe stories in THE SIMPLE ART OF MURDER, though, are earlier stories, and some of their detectives have characters that would not let them be easily renamed after Marlowe. For example the hero of \"Spanish Blood,\" the first story in this collection, is Hispanic, and that is important to the plot.\n\nChandler looked on his short stories as apprentice work, but some of these early stories have a kind of power that, though cruder, is also different from the power that appears in the novels. Their detectives are less wittily aloof from the crimes they get involved in, and their lives seem a little dirtier in general. Considering what Marlowe himself goes through, that says quite a bit.\n\nContents of Kindle edition: the essay discussed above, plus eight short stories: Spanish Blood, I'll Be Waiting, The King in Yellow, Pearls Are a Nuisance, Pickup on Noon Street, Smart-Aleck Kill, Guns at Cyrano's, and Nevada Gas.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "AGEIT17HENDIS", "ProductID": "B000FBFM1G", "Review": "CHANDLER WARMS UP Update 2013\n\nIn the beginning was the ...idea. That is Raymond Chandler decided that he had had enough of sweet parlor talk detectives filled to the brim with logical and deductive abilities to solve the crime, the crime of murder if you need to know, before noon and then lunch at the Savoy. Or alternatively solve the dastardly deed before dinner and then reminisce over after dinner brandies and cigars at the club. Nice stuff, nice except murder and its detection is not quite so simple and linear. In fact it is messy, daunting, and done sometimes for reasons that no logical parlor think could fathom. So Chandler once he decided that he needed to air out the room tried to give us a more realistic appraisal of what solving murder (or any crime for that matter) was all about in the real world. And more importantly what kind of guy, what kind of detective guy, and it was mostly guys in his time, could measure up to such tasks.\n\nWe all know that ultimately Philip Marlowe, Philip of the seven novels (crime novels if you like but I would argue just novels and let them fall where they may in that genre), who became the proto-type, or one of the proto-types, of the hard-boiled but honest and clever detectives that dominate the genre now. Yes, Marlowe was the quintessential tough private eye but he did not spring up from nowhere and the book under review, The Simple Art Of Murder, a selection of short stories from early in the late-blooming Chandler's literary arsenal put paid to that point. Here Chandler was working out the code that Marlowe will eventually follow, the code of the honest detective doing honest work in this wicked old world in order to bring a smidgen of justice to the cases in front of him.  To make a living as well. And not be afraid to take an occasional bong on the head or a stray slug for the good of the cause.\n\nWe see various types of detectives from a house dick I'll Be Waiting to semi-public detective in The King In Yellow to a light throwback parlor private eye in Pearls Are A Nuisance to the hard-boiled bong and slug tough guy in Nevada Gas all trying to work out a suitable code of honor, to not duck when danger is around, to be cynical but focused if necessary and to keep a very long distance from the long arm of the law when necessary. So if you are looking for how an iconic literary and cinematic character began in the churning process this compilation is a primer. And if that isn't enough reason to read this book then the essay The Simple Art Of Murder where Chandler lays down the challenge (along with Dashiell Hammett) to the then current orthodoxy in detection novels (that parlor stuff mentioned above) is more than enough reason to do so.\n\nOh yah, about Raymond Chandler, about the guy who wrote the book. Like I said in another review he, along with Brother Dashiell Hammett (the author of The Thin Man, and creator of The Maltese Falcon's Sam Spade maybe the most famous tough guy detective of them all. Who, come to think of it, also had a judgment problem when it came to women, although not Hollywood women but up north in Frisco town) turned the dreary gentile drawing-room sleuth by-the-numbers crime novels that dominated the reading market back in the day on its head and gave us tough guy blood and guts detectives we could admire, could get behind, warts and all. Thanks, guys.\n\nIn Chandler's case he drew strength from his startling use of language to describe Marlowe's environment much in the way a detective would use his heightened powers of observation during an investigation, missing nothing. Marlowe was able to size up, let's say, a sizzling blonde, as a statuesque, full-bodied and ravishing dame and then pick her apart as nothing but a low-rent gold-digger. Of course that never stopped him from taking a run at one or two of them himself and then sending them off into the night, or to the clink, to fend for themselves. He also knew how to blow off a small time chiseler, a grifter, as so much flamboyance and hot air not neglecting to notice that said grifter had moisture above his upper lip indicating that he stood in fear of something if only his shadow as he attempted to pull some caper, or tried to pull the wool over Marlowe's eyes. Or noticing a frayed collar or a misshapen dress that indicated that a guy or gal was on cheap street and just maybe not on the level.\n\nThe list of such descriptive language goes on and on -sullen bartenders wiping a random whisky glass, flighty chorus girls arm in arm with wrong gee gangsters, Hollywood starlet wannabes displaying their wares a little too openly, old time geezers, toothless, melting away in some thankless no account job, guys working out of small-time airless no front cheap jack offices in rundown building s on the wrong side of town doing, well, doing the best they can. And cops, good cops, bad cops, all with that cop air about them of seen it all, done it all blas, and by the way spill your guts before the billy- club comes down (that spill your guts thing a trait that our Marlowe seems organically incapable of having). He had come from them, from the D.A.s office in the old days, had worked with them on plenty of cases but generally he tried to treat them like one might a snake not quite sure whether it is poisonous or not.\n\nAt the same time Chandler was a master of setting the details of the space Marlowe had to work in- the high hill mansions and the back alley rooming houses (although usually not the burgeoning ranchero middle class locales since apparently that segment of society has not need of his services and therefore no need of a description of their endless sameness and faux gentility). He has a fix on the museum-like quality of the big houses, the places like General Sternwood's in The Big Sleep or Mrs. Murdock's in The High Window reflecting old wealth California. And he has a razor sharp sense of the arrivisite, the new blood all splash and glitter, all high-ceiling bungalow, swimming pools, and landscaped gardens.\n\nBut where Chandler made his mark was in his descriptions of the gentile seedy places, the mansions of old time Bunker Hill turned to rooming houses with that faint smell of urine, that strong smell of liquor, that loud noise that comes with people living too close together, too close to breath their simple dreams. Or the descriptions of the back alley offices in the rundown buildings that had seen better days populated by the failed dentists, the sly repo men, the penny ante insurance brokers, the con artists, the flotsam and jetsam of the losers in the great American West night just trying to hang on from rent payment to rent payment. Those denizens of these quarters usually had a walk on role, or wound up with two slugs to the head, but Chandler knew the type, had the type down solid.\n\nNor was Chandler above putting a little social commentary in Marlowe's mouth. Reflections on such topics as that very real change after World War II in the kind of swarms that were heading west to populate the American Western shore night. The rise of the corner boys hanging, just hanging, around blasted storefronts, a few breaking off into the cranked up hot rod hell's highway night. The restless mobsters for broken back east looking to bake out in the southern California sun while taking over the vast crime markets. The wannabe starlets ready to settle for less than stardom for the right price. The old California money (the gold rush, gold coast, golden era money) befuddled by the all new waves coming in. And above all a strong sense of the rootlessness, the living in the moment, the grabbing while the grabbing was good mentality that offended old Marlowe's honor code.\n\nAnd of course over a series of books Chandler expanded the Marlowe character, expanded his range of emotions, detailed his growing world-weariness, his growing wariness, his small compromises with that code of honor that he honed back in the 1930s. Yes, Marlowe the loner, the avenging angel , the righter of wrongs, maybe little wrongs but wrongs in this wicked old world. The guy who sometimes had to dig deep in his office desk drawer to grab a shot or six of whiskey to help him think things through. Marlowe the guy of a thousand punches, the guy of a hundred knocks on the head, the guy who had taken a more than one slug for the cause, the guy who was every insurance company's nightmare and a guy who could have used some Obamacare health insurance no questions asked . Yah, Marlowe.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nI have reviewed Raymond Chandler's seven Phillip Marlowe detective classics elsewhere in this space so there is no need to go into detail about his place in the detective genre pantheon. What is interesting in this series of short works is that Chandler is working out the 'formula' for what he expects out of his detectives. Those qualities get worked out in Marlowe and thus take their place as very good literary work indeed. Even here Chandler exhibits the sparse but functional dialogue that holds the Marlowe series together. If you have never read Chandler in novel or short story form here is your chance. There will be no place for Agatha Christie-type parlor detectives for you after that. For sure.\n\nIf nothing else get this book for his essay that gives this work its title. This is his take at the time (early 1950's)  on the genre's place in the literary pantheon. Now his long ago off-hand remarks are the wisdom of the academy. Enough said.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "ASB8HV1YQNSON", "ProductID": "B000FBFM1G", "Review": "You can't beat Raymond Chandler The thing about Raymond Chandler is his ability to put words together in the most intriguing, descriptive way.  His prose is beyond readable -- it's captivating.  The first book of his I read was \"Farewell, My Lovely.\"  I read a couple of paragraphs and I was simply hooked.  The stories themselves are wonderful, but told by a lesser author, they wouldn't be half as good.\n\nThe sad thing about Chandler is that he got started rather late in life with his writing and he didn't get that many books written before he died.  Today, you can find about eight books, comprising six novels and two collections of short stories.  \"The Simple Art of Murder\" is one of the short story collections.\n\nChandler's famous fictional detective, Philip Marlowe does not appear in any of the short stories in this book because these are his earlier works.  They appeared in magazines and he hadn't dreamt up Marlowe yet.  But the stories are so worth reading.  One of Chandler's gifts is his ability to describe people, places and the times without being at all boring.  The net result is that, while you're reading, you're there, back in the Los Angeles of the 1930's and 40's, experiencing how it used to look, how it once felt, what life there was once like.  It's almost intoxicating in its effects.\n\nThose who have read some of the Philip Marlowe novels will find a couple of interesting things.  With a little re-working, you'll find a couple of his short stories in the novels as chapters of the larger works.\n\nOne of the really interesting things about this particular collection is the opening work, not a story but an essay entitled \"The Simple Art of Murder.\"  It's Raymond Chandler's commentary on what it takes to write a good murder mystery and, believe it or not, it's a very interesting read.  It's entertaining and insightful, not in the least bit dry, and proof positive that Chandler could really write.  The man was truly gifted and not to read him is to missing something excellent indeed.\n\nThe phrase \"pulp fiction\" generally conveys something of lesser quality, trash, in fact.  I'll never make that assumption again having read Raymond Chandler, master of the genre.  Few authors in any genre have been able to write as well as he did.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Some other people are commenting on the old book.\n\nBefore you read all the other comments here, please be clear that this book is not like Chandler's other books. Unfortunately, some other people commenting on this book have not read the book - obviously. This book does not contain his character Philip Marlowe. He might have been in the 1968 version, I do not know. Here we have an essay by Chandler called \"The Simple Art of Murder,\" followed by 8 short stories, each about 40 pages long. In some ways, these are a sampling of Chandler's \"other stories.\" They still involve an LA based private detective, but each leading male protagonist has a different personality.\n\nThe great attraction of this book is the essay by Chandler on how he writes, and what he thinks of other writers. After reading the esssay, I immediately ran out and bought Hemingway's \"Farewell to Arms.\" Chandler thought that this book probably has the best prose of 20th century novels. In the essay Chandler tells us about his philosophy to writing crime stories, and he makes comments on other writers from Hemingway to British mystery writer Dorothy Sayers. It is a good essay by Chandler but short.\n\nI have read all 7 Chandler novels plus the short stories \"Trouble is My Business.\" One can make the argument that the present book is perhaps his best work; although, the short story format does not make for an impressive read - as we see for example in \"Farewell, My Lovely,\" or other full novels.\n\nAs a Chandler fan I read this introduction four times, and read most other stories twice. \"Smart-Aleck Kill\" has a very complicated plot compressed into a very short format. I ended up reading it three times before all the characters were clear in my mind. Eventually the binding of this new book came apart. There is no Philip Marlowe, but this is an excellent sample of Chandler's writing skills.\n\nChandler wrote detective mystery stories, and became famous for seven novels and a number of Hollywood screen plays, mostly about crime and private detectives in the \"film noir\" genre of Hollywood black and white films, or what is called LA \"pulp fiction\". Far from being an ordinary writer of cheap crime stories, Chandler became one of America's best writers from the mid 20th century. His fame was of course helped by Bogat and Bacall starring in the film \"The Big Sleep\" based on Chandler's first novel.\n\nIn any case, this is a book that is not to be missed by Chandler fans. It is simply excellent for anyone else.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Norton & Co.  There are major differences between this edition and the Black Lizard paperback depicted above.  Most significantly, the 1968 version contains 4 stories the Black Lizard paperback does not.)\n\nThe Simple Art of Murder is a collection of author favorites culled from short works of crime fiction by the legendary Raymond Chandler.  The title, The Simple Art of Murder, is the same as that of an essay Chandler wrote in 1945.  That essay, which can be found in this book, is a distillation of the author's views on the contemporary state of detective fiction, its future and its limitations.  Whether you agree or disagree with the conclusions it presents, you will find it highly valuable reading, as it explains why and how Chandler wrote as he did.\n\nAll twelve stories (remember, this is the 1968 edition) are good and some are great.  Though one of them, Goldfish, takes place mostly in Washington State, they all bring to life the dark, grittiness of Los Angeles' criminal netherworld.  Finger Man, Goldfish, Red Wind and Trouble is My Business all feature the legendary private eye Phillip Marlowe.  These are the 4 stories missing from the Black Lizard edition.\n\nNevada Gas differs from the rest of the stories in this collection in that the main character is not an investigator but rather a gambler named Johnny De Ruse.  Except for the gentlemanly Walter Gage (Pearls are a Nuisance) all the protagonists of the remaining non-Marlowe stories are very Marlowe-like in personality.  In fact, Johnny Dalmas (Smart-Aleck Kill) seems to differ from Phillip Marlowe in name only.\n\nOne of the best stories in The Simple Art Murder is Pick-Up on Noon Street.  In it, Pete Anglisch, a narcotics detective deep undercover, rescues a vulnerable young woman caught up in a complex blackmail scheme.  The captivating Red Wind is also very strongly written.\n\nJust like the Phillip Marlowe novels which brought Chandler his well deserved fame, these hardboiled shorter works are characterized by great dialogue and very effective descriptive passages.  Reading this collection gives one an appreciation for the intelligence and craftsmanship Raymond Chandler applied to his writing.  Highly recommended.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The detective pulps such as \"Black Mask\" and \"Dime Detective\" were training grounds for the like of Erle Stanley Gardner, Dashell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler.\nThis volume gives us Raymond Chandler's essay of the detective genre plus twelve novellas and short stories basically from the pulp magazines.\nFour of these are Phillip Marlowe adventures, all written before the novels.  Of these, \"Goldfish\" and \"Trouble is My Business\" truly stand out.  However, there are three others:  \"Smart-Aleck Kill\" with Johnny Dalmas, the notable \"Guns at Cyrano's\" with Ted Carmady, and \"The King in Yellow\" featuring hotel detective turned private eye Steve Grayce.  Each of these three stories feature a very obvious antecedent to Phillip Marlowe.\nRaymond Chandler is noted especially for his concise but rich descriptions of locale and also of characters.  These are practically photographic descriptions.  Also, there's Chandler's dialogue complete with sardonic humor and wisecracks.  The plot is swift paced with nary a dull moment.  He was well trained by BLACK MASK's editor who suggested that whenever the plot threatens to bog down, have a man with a gun in his hand walk into the scene.\nDashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler shaped the tough private eye genre which spawned Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, Richard Prather's Shell Scott, Robert Parker's Spenser, and also today's police detective genre, most notably Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.\nChandler termed this genre, as opposed to the more genteel Agatha Christy type of mystery, \"realistic\".  Well, that's arguable.  I don't know about you, but I don't ordinarily find dead bodies whenever I walk into an empty room, nor are the people who knock on my door likely to have guns in their hands, or even on their persons, so I question the \"realistic\" label.  But these stories are good fun.  The body count is rather high in most of the stories, and you can often figure out who the murderer is by eliminating the characters who get killed along the way.\nBe that as it may, this volume is indeed highly recommended.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I did not remember that until the end of the Kindle book where the list of the author's books can be found.\n\nHere I was not remembering I had read Moon before - one of my favorite authors at that time - Moon, McCaffrey, Cherryh - I spent many, many hours reading their works.\n\nI loved this book - and will be purchasing the entire series. Military SF is my favorite genre. Drake, Heinlein, Ringo, Weber, Stirling, Flint, Herbert and of course Moon, McCaffrey and Cherryh.\n\nMuch of the plot is boilerplate - the \"strong willed female commander facing unbeatable odds after suffering an unfair, life-shattering setback\" storylines.  Weber's Honor Harrington comes to mind, but honestly I think Moon handles it much better with Kylara Vatta.  Think a mix of Card, Weber and Drake with obvious influences from McCaffrey.\n\nWhat we have is a protagonist with daddy issues, misunderstood by all, drummed out of the military (in the first few pages so no spoilers)  sent out in near-exile on a milk-run. But her family seems to live by the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, with trade and profit above all and being the driving force of her increasingly hazardous life.

{"ReviewerID": "A1AVZU83CYUM6E", "ProductID": "B000FBJBA4", "Review": "Clumsy and unconvincing This book deserves some wheres between 2 and 3 stars. It's an attempt to be the typical young adult learns about herself and her place in the world story, but falls short. The protagonist is so exceptionally neurotic, and wears it on her sleeve, that I find it implausible she'd be seen as any kind of leader. Ky lives in a world where nearly everyone is unhelpful, where apparently despite her father's wealth and influence, doors shut in her face time after time and where mid-level bureaucrats go out of their way to be officious and make enemies. Give me a break. There's a fundamental misunderstanding here of what power and influence are, I think. The author's attempt to show-off Ky's trading skills also fall flat. Moon's idea of a negotiator is someone who browses on-line prices, makes zero attempt at face to face negotiating, and settles for what she is offered. We are told how wonderful Ky is, but nothing I saw (with one violent exception) reinforces that; Moon just can't pull it off. My reaction is too often \"This isn't the way a young person thinks or acts...\" If you're willing to be told (everyone around Ky is more than willing to tell her how impressed they are with her) what to think about her, then you've passed one hurdle in enjoying this book. As the first of a series, perhaps the holes will be plugged in later books. The big problem I have is why doesn't Ky see these holes? The underclassman who sabotaged her - she (and her family!) just shrug off his indirect assault?? Her \"boy friend\" who turns out to be not only a selfish cad (apparently, the concept that one important lesson TEENAGERS learn is to pick their friends, isn't true here) but more than willing to make an enemy for inexplicable motivations. What?!  And where did those two mystery ships go? Why didn't Ky care? I guess I just don't get it. No one seems on the ball enough to see the potential for hostile intent operating behind the scenes? Really? In a world where electronic systems are pervasive, potential hacking is disregarded? Really? Ky is put in a situation where she really should know, based on her training, that she needs help to supervise the \"passengers\" she's given, yet she asks for none. The question you should ask is: is such a blunder - which is a key plot turning point - consistent with how \"wily\" she supposedly is? Ky's only real talent, from what I see, is she's astoundingly financially lucky. She is presented on a plate with money making deals when she needs them, time after time. There seems to be two stories here: one of a wonderkind blazing a path to become a Galaxy class entrepreneur and the other of an average kid who is muddling through the obstacles life throws at her. The first has no bearing (aside from in Moon's mind) with what actually happens, and the second could have made a great story if the protagonist just wasn't so whiny (she talks down to herself constantly).", "Feedback": "negative"}

If you're going to embark on this series, there's a caveat.\n\nIn Trading In Danger (Book I), we're introduced to Kylara Vatta, a young woman who comes from a wealthy interstellar shipping family. After she's been kicked out of the Spaceforce Academy, she's given a routine assignment commanding a ship due to be scrapped. However, she has other plans...\n\nI enjoyed Ky's determination to strike out on her own and forge a life apart from her family. Her character and voice are vivid - she's resourceful, stubborn, and trusting. This last quality is what gets her into trouble. Moon keeps throwing obstacles at Ky and it's enjoyable to see how the young captain deals with them.\n\nBooks 2-4 continue her story by upping the stakes and introducing new characters. It's wonderful to see Ky mature and develop her leadership talent. Aunt Grace's fruitcakes provide a thread throughout.\n\nUnfortunately, having invested so much in the characters and story, Victory Conditions (Book 5), comes as a disappointment. Moon rushed to finish the series and it shows with sloppy, lazy writing. She did the same with her Heris Serrano Trilogy. It's a shame because both series were keepers and deserved better.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

It's a highly entertaining sci-fi adventure story. Moon does an especially good job with the military aspects, especially the ins and outs of communications during war and the choreography of space battles.\n\nFor many reasons the series, especially the first volume, invites comparisons with Lois Bujold's Vorkosigan series, which unfortunately spotlights the weaknesses here: the shallowness of the overarching allegory, a general lack of humor and the corresponding absence of irony that implies (with the notable exception of everything to do with the dog, Puddles/Rascal,) villains about as interesting as Sauron's eyeball o' flame, little interest in or distinctiveness to the secondary characters.\n\nIn general, I am not a fan of hugely ambitious sci-fi allegories, what I usually label \"Dune yada yada,\" but the lack of any larger stakes than \"WE MUST DEFEAT EVIL\" did in the end make this series less than it could be. To give just one example, the story hints at some of the difficulties female officers face--people are always assuming that Ky has fallen in love with any handsome man who comes her way--but it doesn't go any further than that, for example by really getting into the sexism of military culture or (like Bujold's Beta Colony) trying to imagine a culture where gender is mostly irrelevant.\n\nWhat we're left with is a rip-roaring, highly suspenseful action-story in space.

It may be something of a formula for her, but she does it very well, and I don't mind it. The plot clicks along at a good pace, and the minor characters are sufficiently varied.\n\nThis book's main character, Ky Vatta, may have a bit more to learn, a more significant failing to overcome, than some of Moon's comparable characters -- and that's just fine.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A3IYTNZTDHZW0Y", "ProductID": "B000FBJBA4", "Review": "Mediocre Story, Superb Production Kylara Evangeline Dominique Vatta is a likeable enough heroine, if a bit on the stereotypical side.  She's young and enthusiastic, perhaps a bit too trusting, and prone to fits of hot-headedness.  The youngest of five siblings, and the only girl in a wealthy and successful family, all Ky really wants is to make a name for herself.  Lacking any real experience, she often is forced to rely on her own instincts and intuition, which turn out to be surprisingly good most of the time.  In other words, Kylara is just the kind of person we love to cheer for.\n\nI like the way Ky handles herself in tough situations, although some of those situations are a little too contrived for my liking.  In the naval academy, Ky tries to help a friend who, as it turns out, was trying to discredit the military, and she is expelled.  That punishment was way more severe than necessary, but the scene does serve to show us that Ky is a good-natured person who truly wants to help people whenever possible.  Later on, Ky inadvertently takes her ship and crew into a star system where war is breaking out.  Many of the events that transpire from this don't make much sense logically, but again they serve to give us more insights into Ky's nature, namely that she is a capable captain and will do whatever is necessary to protect her ship and crew.\n\nThe real saving grace to Trading in Danger is the audio production.  Graphic Audio specializes in turning books into full cast dramatizations, complete with music and sound effects. This particular production was beautifully done, with sound and music that truly enhance the story rather than distracting the listener.\n\nAs to the cast, what you have basically is a main narrator, and several voice actors who read the parts of the various characters.  The main narrator, and I believe also the voice of Kylara, is Cynthia Holloway, who did a more than adequate job.  The other actors are too numerous to name here, but I'm happy to say that they are all named in the recording.  That makes me happy because sometimes full-cast audio productions neglect to name the actors, so thank you for that Graphic Audio.\n\nTrading in Danger wasn't the best story, what you might call a space opera I suppose, but there's plenty of fast-paced action to keep you listening.

We know exactly what killed them -- I killed them!\"\n\nKylara Vatta, daughter of the head of the most prestigious shipping empire in the universe, didn't want to follow in her family's footsteps -- trading is boring and Ky wants adventure and her own life outside of her family's control. So she opted for a military career. But with only a few months left in the officer's academy, she was set-up, betrayed, kicked out, and publicly shamed. When she returns home in disgrace, Vatta Transport is happy to have her back in the fold. Her first assignment is to captain a derelict spaceship straight to the junkyard, but Ky has Vatta blood in her veins and can't pass up an advantageous business opportunity that arises unexpectedly. When this leads her into various forms of danger, and when scammers and mutineers think they can take advantage of the young and inexperienced captain, Ky finds that her time spent in the military academy wasn't wasted after all.\n\nTrading in Danger is the first installment of Elizabeth Moon's VATTA'S WAR military science fiction epic. I don't think this series will appeal to everybody, but it happened to hit a sweet spot for me. I like Kylara Vatta, an intelligent ethical rules-bound military officer with a soft heart who, due to her new circumstances, is beginning to discover that she has a rebellious streak, not to mention a disconcerting appreciation for quickly solving problems with violence. Ky is a little passive and occasionally bewildered in this installment, but this is her first adventure. I'm assuming that Moon plans to show us some growth in this area as Ky begins to adapt to her new lifestyle. Kylara's crew and family members are also likeable -- especially elderly Aunt Grace who bakes unappetizing but invaluable fruitcakes.\n\nThe plot is engaging, unpredictable and mostly quick-moving though some of the dialog gets repetitive as Ky explains what's going on to multiple characters who show up at different times. I enjoyed the focus on transportation, though this may be a personal thing. My husband runs a small freight logistics company, so there's a lot of talk about contracts, cargo, carriers and consignees in my little world, and I was fascinated by how this might scale up to apply to an entire universe. Surprisingly, this was one of my favorite aspects of the story but, again, that's just me. (It would be such an awful pun to say \"your mileage may vary\" so I won't.)\n\nTrading in Danger is \"soft\" science fiction, or \"space opera\" -- it's a little fluffy, focusing on drama and political intrigue, not physics. There's talk about FTL drives and ansibles (there's a nod to Ursula K. LeGuin), but no explanation of how they work. I love physics but have to admit that I get bored by long dry theoretical or technical discussions of astrophysics and quantum mechanics. Trading in Danger is a quick and easy read for when you're in the mood for some non-challenging science fiction. It ends on an intriguing note -- Ky has some difficult choices to make about her relationship to her family business. Should she stay with Vatta or go rogue? Whatever, I'm still on board and ready for the ride.\n\nI'm listening to VATTA'S WAR in audio format. These were produced in 2008 by Tantor Audio and are read by Cynthia Holloway who does a nice job. I like her voice and she inflects the narrative perfectly (though she always mispronounces the word \"peripheral\"). I recommend the audio version.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Exactly what happened, and why it's a Bad Thing, is never really explained, but Ky ends up taking the heat and is thrown out. Luckily (or not), she's the younger daughter of a wealthy space mercantile company and her father and uncle pack her off on a routine voyage -- her first command, though a very small one -- to remove her from the public eye and the reach of the media. And, since she's a Vatta, her elders are pretty sure she'll stray from the job they gave her in search of trade and profit, since they all did the same thing their first time out. Sure enough, Ky and her ship and her small crew (the senior members of whom have been given a certain amount of babysitting to do) take on a contract that leads them off their assigned mission, and into a suddenly erupting war zone. And the action proceeds from there, more or less satisfactorily, most of the time. Moon has a military background herself and is quite capable of producing headlong adventure with strong female characters (the Deed of Paksenarrion trilogy comes to mind), but this one seems rather bland, somehow. The style is meant to be introspective from young Ky's point of view -- will she ever get people to take her seriously? -- but comes off being superficial, somehow. There's no real science here, either, the technology of FTL and all that being passed over in jargon, but that's a tradition in SF juveniles. So while this is a perfectly readable way to spend a Saturday afternoon, it's not at all memorable and not even close to the author's best.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

A friend finally convinced me to take the plunge, and begin here, with her first Vatta novel.\n\nI am glad that I did.\n\nSet in a space opera universe of FTL travel, ansibles for FTL communication, and a balkinized polity of trading planets, pirates, mercenary companies and more, Trading in Danger is the story of Kylara (Ky) Vatta. Unlike her trading oriented family, she's more interested in a military career. This career path goes off the rails in the first chapter of the book, as she is cashiered out of the military academy for what seemed to be an innocent attempt to help a fellow classmate.\n\nScandalous!  Her family decides that a change of scenery and away from the media lights of her home planet of Slotter's Key. The Glennys Jones is one of the oldest ships in the Vatta trading fleet and due for scrap. Send Ky to captain the falling-apart ship for one last mission, with the end point of the mission having the ship being scrapped on a distant planet, and have her charter transportation back home for her and her crew. In the meantime, the scandal will have been forgotten\n\nSimple, right?\n\nAlthough she assiduously avoided joining the family business to this point, Ky cannot resist the chance to make some \"trade and profit.\" And in the quest for that, winds up in an unfamiliar solar system that is just about ready to break out into civil war...\n\nMoon is the sort of space opera writer that reminds me of Bujold in many ways. The technical details are plot oriented and relatively general in their details. Readers looking for lovingly thought out technical details of an FTL drive are going to be disappointed here. The technological details here serve character development and plot. And it is there, especially the character development, that Moon shines. Ky is a fully formed and envisioned three dimensional character, who has strengths, weaknesses, personality and who grows and changes in the course of the novel. Even when she does the wrong thing (for the right reasons), she is a sympathetic viewpoint character and Moon makes her the hard core of the novel. Her secondary characters are also well drawn as well, and contrast well against Ky, ranging from her family, to her crew, to those she tangles with in the course of her story.\n\nThe pacing is a bit slow as far as the action goes, its clear Moon is more interested in character development and starting the building of her world here than anything else. I was never precisely bored, but there are stretches that are less action packed than others. I also suspect that there might have been a larger book here that Moon decided to trim. Some subplots and ideas are mentioned and dropped in, but not fully explored. This may be a case of Chekov's Law, as applied to subsequent novels.\n\nSpeaking of subsequent novels, despite the relatively minor detractions, I definitely be looking to continue to read Ky's story in the subsequent novels in this series.", "Feedback": "positive"}

During this time she picks up a few marooned spacers who cause trouble and which results in some all new problems and opportunities.\n\nI felt this story started off very weakly.

I was ignorant.  So I couldn't have been more happy to find that I enjoy Moon's style of writing and ability to truly create a real and believable story.\n\nMoon writes straight to the point.  There are no pages long diatribes and/or explanations that do nothing more than bog a story down.  Don't get me wrong.  If done correctly, that can work.  Neal Stephenson comes to mind.  But it can fail just as often as it could work.  Neal Stephenson comes to mind.  But with Moon she is to the point, there is no beating about the bush.  we don't have to read through a hundred pages to cover a span of 2 weeks, but mere sentences would suffice in summing up all that was important and relay it to the reader, all the while not cheapening the storyline.\n\nKy is an altogether believable character, one that I at times admired and cheered along, feeling as though I were going through the motions of a first time captaincy.  Her interactions with Gary and Quincy and the other officers and staff was not forced or unbelievable, but accurate (seemingly at least, after all I have never been on a space ship) and to the point.  Her interactions with her family were honest and heartfelt, and I couldn't but nod my head in recognition of her family life.\n\nI am gushing a bit about Moon's Vatta series in part because I had not expected anything when I stumbled upon her book.  Without expectations I was left to enjoy her book for what it was.  And I did truly do that.  Will I think differently of the other books in her series when I get around to reading them?

She returned home, avoiding media, to regroup herself. Her father, Gerard Vatta of Vatta Transport, decided Ky needed to go away until the media circus calmed down a bit. So she was sent as captain to take an old space craft on its last journey, to Belinta first and then to the scrap yard. She had a very small crew, but they were all veterans of space.\nAt Belinta, Ky learned that the planet had ordered agriculture \"ag\" equipment over a year ago from Sabine Prime which was picked up by another transport company and never delivered. Belinta was desperate for the equipment. No one named Vatta had ever turned down a chance to profit and Ky was no different. Ky hoped to earn enough money so that her ship could be repaired instead of scrapped. Once the personal contract was signed, she was off to Sabine Prime.\nSabine Prime gave Captain Vatta a bit of trouble, but not much, at first. Ky needed a new FTL drive before she could go anywhere. It was a vital part of the ship. Then she needed to purchase the ag equipment. The problem was figuring out how to get the money. FTL drives were very expensive. It all became worse when chaos erupted. Someone blew up the ISC's ansible platforms, so communications was all but gone. Then war ships came in. Ky's ship had no weapons and, with no FTL drive, no way to leave. She and her crew were defenseless and in the middle of a war between Sabine Prime and mercs!\n**** Very good beginning to what appears to be a series or trilogy. The plots are all tied up by the end, but many sub-plots are left dangling. I would very much like to find out how one or two of them end up, especially the one from the academy.\nThe beginning of the book reminded me a bit of the Honor Harrington series by David Weber. Young woman, military back ground, done horribly wrong, underestimated, and very cunning. Yet by the half way mark, Ky had definitely separated herself from Honor in my mind. Ky has her own way of dealing with things and any emotional trash is put on hold until the crisis is over. All-in-all, VERY GOOD novel.

The journey will keep her out of the public eye, and give the Vatta family a chance to see what Ky can do on her own. Although Ky had been certain she would pursue a career in the military, she quickly turns to the family creed of making money. Unfortunately for Ky, a civil war in the system where she goes to pick up agricultural machinery and problems with her faster-than-light drive lead her to more adventure than most of her academy cohorts will ever see.\nTRADING IN DANGER starts slowly as Ky deals with her rejection at the academy, her first command (almost babysat by extremely senior crewmen and crewwomen) and her grandmother's notorious fruitcake. Once mercenaries attack the system where she is taking on cargo and intersystem communications are lost, the pace picks up as Ky is forced to deal with irrational crewmen, mercenaries who would as soon shoot as ask questions, and passengers who have their own ideas of what to do and aren't ready to take Ky's decisions as final.\nAuthor Elizabeth Moon delivers a satisfying story and an intriguing character in Ky Vatta. There did seem to be a number of loose ends that Moon could have integrated more fully into the story, however. The spaceship model seems just a little too perfect. How could the Master Sergeant have guessed exactly what Ky would need? And how did Ky persuade herself not to crack the obvious code that he left her? I also expected a bit more of a bang from the frequently mentioned fruitcake.

Kylara Vatta is a member of a well respected trading family on Slotter Key. Despite, or maybe because of, her family's efforts to dissuade her, Ky is a senior cadet in the planet's spaceforce academy. She has exchanged rings with Hal, who has been trading the top class position with her since they joined the academy.\n\nNow she has been called to the Superintendent's office and asked to resign because an underclassmen has complained on a public news outlet that the academy is unfairly treating his religious group. Ky had thought that she could trust him, but he deliberately took advantage of her gullibility for his own purposes. Ky had been warned by MacRobert, one of the senior NCOs, but had trusted her own feelings too much to believe him. Moreover, MacRobert seems to have presented some sort of message for her in a ship model kit, but she doesn't bother to figure it out.\n\nA Vatta company car picks up Ky at the Academy front gate while MacRobert has the media reporters lured away to the back. She is driven to the company airfield and then flown back home. There she is fussed over, plied with new clothes, and offered the captaincy of an old ship being flown to the scrapyard on Lastway. She will have a preordered cargo for Belinta and spec cargo for Leonora.\n\nOf course, as a brand, spanking new captain, Ky considers the odds of making a profit on the voyage and then bringing her ship up to standards. When she hears from Belinta Customs that they have an agricultural machinery shipment mislaid by Pavrati Interstellar, Ky immediately starts thinking of ways to fetch the missing shipment for the planetary government. After some concentrated negotiating, she unloads her spec cargo and heads for Sabine, the nearest source of ag machinery. Unfortunately, the FTL drive starts falling apart and then Sabine circumspace becomes a warzone. Later the combatants dump fifty hostages in her ship, albeit under contract and with auxiliary materiel and supplies, but still a strain on the ship and crew.\n\nThis story is a form of trial by happenstance, with Ky performing well personally, but having problems with some of the extra people on board. Ky has a reputation for adopting underdogs, but her real problem is that she naively trusts people who appear trustworthy. Her experiences during this voyage, however, seem to have instilled a much needed touch of cynicism in her character.\n\nAlthough Ky is a merchant captain, her experiences as an officer cadet prove to be very valuable during this voyage. She also gets a opportunity to face down several people who consider her little more than a naive, inexperienced girl. A tough trip, but enlightening.\n\nThis is supposed to be the first in a new series. The author is going to have to be exceedingly clever to continue this pace in future volumes, particularly since Ky is only a merchant captain. However, the mercenary company that hired her to house the fifty hostages has actually made an offer of a commission in their unit. Ky might not be a civilian much longer.\n\nHighly recommended for Moon fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure among the spaceways with interesting characters and tense situations.\n\nArthur W.

I was sorry to see the story end, especially as no clear conclusion was reached. That's okay, I'm a grownup, I can handle there not being a defined ending (I've given up on happy endings). Without giving any spoilers, a few thoughts:\n\nTim Winton is so detailed and thorough that you get a sense of every detail in the scenes. The weather, the feel of the dust on your skin, the smells of the eucalyptus, as well as the emotions of the character are felt, not simply read. I didn't care for the main female character, I thought she was unsympathetic and apathetic to other characters, even the one she loves. The male lead is great, but of course, it's fiction! He has to be THAT perfect to make it work.\n\nThe main themes are overcoming your own personality flaws, and the fear of being left behind. Winton's main character Lu has lost everyone he loves; on this journey he meets several characters that could represent those faces from his past. He also has to face the reality that his own perceptions from the past may have been wrong. Horrifyingly so.\n\nRumor has it that this will become a film. Rachel Weisz is signed to play Georgia, which sounds fine. But there is a bit of a mystery regarding Russell Crowe and Colin Farrell. IMDB, the movie database, lists Colin as playing Lu. However, another report says Russell would play Lu. The other main male character, Jim, is pretty fascinating: he could be played by Russell but defintely not Colin. So I'm not sure which is accurate. I hope that Russell plays Lu, but he could do the character Jim Buckridge with a bit of a evil streak which might be interesting to see.\n\nI'd be very interested to see how a screenplay could be written to show the amount of time passing as well as do justice to the Australian terrain and the long stretches without dialogue. My first reaction was that it would be compared with Tom Hank's Castaway. I think Russell could carry that, I don't think Colin has that much depth.\n\nAnyway, this book had me take out the atlas, the dictionary, and use Google several times to see the trees and earthforms he describes. I think a geologist would particularly like this book, lots of rock talk.\n\nLastly, I've noticed that in the three Winton books I've read that Winton seems to idolize children, almost in a mythological way. That's not a bad thing, but it just seems that the children in his books develop almost a fairy like quality of mystery and perfection", "Feedback": "positive"}

I'm really starting to consider Australian literature to be some of the best fiction I've had the pleasure of getting my hands on.  I've already been able to delve into authors like Murray Bail and Elliot Perlman and now I've had the pleasure of reading a stunning novel, `Dirt Music', written by acclaimed Australian author Tim Winton.  I must say this; after this read I surely will be researching his bibliography.\n\n`Dirt Music' takes place in a small fishing town in Western Australia (a fictitious town called White Point) where middle-aged Georgie Jutland is trying to find herself.  She's always been a rebellious and free-spirited woman; at odds with her family constantly, never truly feeling as though she belonged anywhere.  She's longed for a sense of freedom that everyone around her seems to take away, but she lacks the ability to make the needed effort to really save herself from her apparent failings.  She lives with widower Jim Buckridge; a shell of a man who drowns himself in fishing and remains a distant and reclusive mystery to Georgie.  She feels as though she loves him, but she struggles with understanding why.  She cooks for him, she cleans his house and she takes care of his two sons, but at the end of the day she feels alone and cold.\n\nAnd then she meets Lu.\n\nThe man known as Luther Fox comes with some serious baggage.  A beautiful musician who comes from a dishonorable family; Fox has been reduced to a shamateur (fish poacher) due to some unspeakable tragedies in his life.  Let's just say that he his the sole survivor to the Fox name.  When Georgie spots Fox poaching late at night it is her obligation to inform her husband, a local fisherman.  This is their way of living and this man is encroaching on that.  Instead of playing informant she decides to play desperate housewife and starts up a heated affair that is far more than just a one-night stand type thing.  No, it becomes apparent that both Lu and Georgie fill a void within one another; a void they've been trying to fill for a long time.\n\nThe novel effortlessly paints these characters for us, giving us a realistic and authentic portrait of middle-aged despair and self-awareness.  Winton's descriptive prose is littered with beautiful expressions of pure emotion and his languid delivery is a joy to read.\n\nMy one critique, if I were to have any, would be that at times he expounds too much on areas that need little expansion.  He goes to great lengths to flesh out each and every move these characters make, and the prose spans over a good length of time, and so some scenes could have been cut and some time could have been shortened to keep the pacing a little brisker in areas, but in the end it is a trivial complaint when you consider the richly rewarding entirety of the novel.  I felt that the novel's ending was a tad premature (even if the novel spans nearly 500 pages), but it was not a disappointment in the least; it just felt a little too sudden for what I was expecting.\n\nSome novels take a full chapter to wind things down; this one almost feels like the ending is on a solitary page.\n\nIt's still the best thing I've read in quite some time, and certainly a masterful example of pure storytelling at it's finest.  I'd highly recommend this one.  If you enjoy a good dramatic story, filled with love, loss and ample amounts of genuine (and realistic) tension then dive right in, for `Dirt Music' covers all those bases and then some.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Above all, it is about that old solitude, the loneliness, which defies us.\n\nWinton has a prose deep in details that reads almost like something hallucinatory. We dive beneath the surface and meet a world of melancholy inhabited by Georgie, her husband, Jim, and a strange figure called Luther Fox. These three people are trying to overcome their limitations, their pains, and the reader is invited to follow their journey.\n\nIt is an invitation one cannot refuse, because Australian writer Winton beautifully infuses it with local colors and language that make it a very absorbing reading. Any reader can easily relate to the struggle of the trio of characters because they are very real.\n\n\"Dirt Music\" is one of those novels that takes us to another time, another place - still, we can recognize the time and place. The time is urgent, the place, anywhere in this planet.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The problem doesn't lie with the story but with Winton's language which others may find poetic and lyrical, but just seems jarring and obscure to me. His characters spit out half sentences, phrases, punctuated by local slang and references that nobody unfamiliar with the Australian outback will be able to understand.\n\nNotwithstanding, \"Dirt Music\" has a decent story going about two people, one unhappy and listless in a loveless marriage, the other strung out and catatonic with grief after a car accident which wipes out his entire family, how they ignited the last spark of life in each other when their paths crossed one day, with devastating consequences. Damaged people recognise and are drawn like magnets to each other, Winton seems to be saying.\n\nSurprisingly, Georgie and Lu share very little page space. Whereas Georgie's past and character is revealed in words, Winton relies on language and imagery to express Lu's situation, which lies buried beneath his deep freeze reserve. Lu's solitary flight into the wilderness may be key to the story but it goes on for far too long and becomes interminable. The Georgie chapters are far more satisfying.\n\nNot as good as \"The Riders\". Disappointing.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

And the environment, the mis en place of Western Australia, added to the sense of place and time these characters lived in, as they struggled to find their place in the world, and with one another.\nLuthor is one of the most original characters I've met in a book. He was a revelation. His self imposed trials, endured in the wilderness, at first so meaningless, becomes profound as the experience unfolds for us to share.\nGeorgie is a woman as lost to her needs, as Luthor is lost in the tropical jungles. No sense of herself, no grasp on what she really wants, her quest to find Luthor is really a quest to find herself.\nI just loved this book.

Baker weaves several plot lines  together to create a complex tapestry depicting life in that era.\n\nTammany Hall controls the city.  Even the mayor is a puppet for corrupt politicians.  Factory workers  put in long hours  in squalid sweatshops for low pay.  Gangsters and criminals roam the city looking for easy prey.  Homeless children sleep in alleyways.  Prostitutes, con men and corrupt policemen are everywhere.  As one character in the novel says, \"Everyone has a racket in this town.\"\n\nBaker contrasts the struggle of life in the city with the fantasy world of the Coney Island amusement parks.  He describes how each summer the people of the city come to shrug off their cares and embrace the hedonistic pleasures of the parks.\n\nTo tell his story, Baker uses a large cast of interesting characters.  Each character has a unique point of view.\n\nSome of Bakers memorable characters are:\n\nEssie who escapes the drudgery of work in a sweat shop by having an affair with a gangster hiding out in Dreamland.\n\nKid Twist who came to America by walking across Europe and stowing away in ship bound for New York.\n\nBig Tim Sullivan who is a corrupt Tammany politician.  He controls saloons, gangsters, and the Mayor of New York.\n\nThe Great Head Doctors from Vienna who are Sigmund Freud and his protege Carl Jung.  They give a European perspective to the chaos of New York.\n\nTrick the Dwarf is the narrator of the story.  Trick sometimes enters regular society by passing as a young boy.  He experiences the best and worst times of the Dreamland amusement park.\n\nFor me, this novel was a long slow struggle to finish.  I kept reading because I wanted to find out how Baker resolved the plot lines.  Spoiler Alert - He doesn't.  He brings the story to an end, but there is no great climax.  And perhaps  that is the point.  In real life not all of our plot lines are resolved.  We may escape reality for a while, but life goes on.\n\nThis novel is  a very well written historical novel.

The nascent union movement, the Tammany Hall \"fixers,\" and corrupt police exist side by side with the arrival of Freud and Jung on a college speaking tour, the excitements promised by carney barkers in the fanciful \"cities\" at Coney Island, and the growth of young love.\n\nFilled to the brim with historical detail which brings the city to brutal, and sometimes grotesque, life, the novel focuses primarily on four characters: Gyp the Blood, a young thug who exists on the margins of organized crime; Kid Twist, a young stowaway who arrives from Europe seeking a better life; Trick the Dwarf, who often impersonates a child in his scams; and Esther Abramowitz, a young woman who supports her studious rabbi father by working twelve to fourteen hours a day as a seamstress at the doomed Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.\n\nAs Esther works, becomes a committed union member, and falls in love with Kid, we see the plight of women who must fulfill family responsibilities at enormous costs to themselves, and as we come to know her family, we see the various paths taken by its members as they carve out a place in life. Her relationship with one of the city's many prostitutes illustrates the desperation of some women who are on their own, and how close she herself is to the dividing line between them. Kid Twist, though more thoughtful, is not far from the brutal Gyp in his efforts to control his life, and Trick the Dwarf, while yearning for a \"normal\" relationship, scrabbles about among the city's lowlife trying to find a place in the world.\n\nBaker is a master of odd details from the period, filling the novel with wide-ranging historical background and developing his characters just enough to make the plot seem plausible, despite its remarkable coincidences, and its sense of melodrama. The picture of humanity here is dark, with many scenes designed to shock. The mob's delight in torture, the factory owners' abuse of workers, the brutality of protection rackets, the sudden devastating fires, and the bleakness of everyday life are sustained for almost seven hundred jam-packed pages. Told in lively prose which never flags, and filled with crisp dialogue (and dialect), the novel's dozens of action scenes create an indelible picture of the turn of the century when life was cheap. n Mary Whipple\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Strivers-Row/dp/B000MGAI1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Strivers Row</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Paradise-Alley-A-Novel/dp/B00029ZWLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Paradise Alley : A Novel</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sometimes-You-See-It-Coming-A-Novel/dp/0060535970/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sometimes You See It Coming: A Novel</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Biography-Baker-Kevin-Breen-1958-An-article-from-Contemporary-Authors-Online/dp/B0007SGRP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Biography - Baker, Kevin (Breen) (1958-): An article from: Contemporary Authors Online</a>", "Feedback": "positive"}

It's the same guy, but Baker has the chops to do both, as he is the chief historical researcher for the NEW YORK TIMES.\n\n As I began to read, I was immediately reminded of several other books. AMERICAN TRAGEDY, THE ALIENIST, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, and even CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The setting is New York City with Coney Island featured most of the time. There are gangsters and factory girls and Tammany Hall politicians and they all speak their own unique language, some Yiddish and Bowery slang. Thankfully I checked out the back of the book. Sure enough, there was a glossary. You'll be paging back and forth for the entire read.\n\n There really isn't any main character, but Esse Abramowitz; her brother \"Gyp the Blood;\" Esse's lover Josef Kolykia, alias \"Kid Twist;\" and Tammany Hall politician Big Tim Sullivan do most of the heavy lifting. Trick the Dwarf tells the story. There is a dramatis personae provided at the beginning to help you keep track.\n\n The plot begins when Kid Twist saves Trick the Dwarf's life at a Rat Bating by nailing Gyp the Blood with a shovel. For the rest of the book, Gyp the Blood is out to get Kid Twist. A subplot involves Esse Abramowitz's increasingly involvement in the Labor movement. She also works at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co., and if you're up on your history, you know what happened there.\n\n I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Trick the Dwarf suggests what MIGHT have happened to the major actors, rather than telling us. There's also a subplot involving Sigmund Freud that seems to be included just to add some historical credence. As Baker tells us in his acknowledgments, Freud really did visit America in 1909, but his conflict with Carl Jung doesn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything.\n\n Despite my misgivings, I heartily recommend this book for the Coney Island atmosphere and the Yiddish jargon alone.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The reader may experience more verisimilitude as a result, but that does not, nor should it, relieve the author of the obligation to edit. The novel is overlong, in what may be a misguided attempt to fool readers into believing they're getting a better deal for their money.\n\nGood stories should not be required to support more side trips than are necessary. Nevertheless, long though it may be, this is a cracking good story, and for the most part well told. Bennie Rosato is a prominent, successful, criminal attorney who runs her own law firm in Philadelphia. It is a firm of women lawyers, some of whom come with considerable family baggage. Rosato is not excluded. She never had the standard nuclear family, her father apparently split long before Bennie had any real memories of him. Her mother is dying in a nursing home and Bennie has no one with whom to share that burden.\n\nWith only a week to go before the trial starts, drug dealer Alice Connolly, a woman accused of murdering her cop-lover, demands a new lawyer, specifically, the woman she claims is her twin sister, Bennie Rosato. Rosato has always known she was an only child. When Rosato meets with Connolly, loudly claiming a frame-up by the Philadelphia PD, she learns to her considerable and additional consternation that Connolly has been guided to the decision to contact Bennie, by an old man who claims to be the women's father. This can only be the case, of course, if Connolly is in fact, Bennie's sister.\n\nConnolly is one of the most interesting characters in he book. Street-wise, tough as nails and amply capable of murder, her first and only priority is to use this possible connection with Bennie Rosato to get off and out from under the death penalty that goes with conviction.\n\nRosato, still wondering after many years of self-examination, what her family might have been, is forced by circumstances to renew the old questions and try to find the man claiming to be her father. Scottoline, a good writer, expertly weaves into the book, the story of the cloying, overly protective family of one of her associates as stark contrast to her own fragmented family. But having established her context and parameters, it's almost as if the author wants to be sure everyone who reads Mistaken Identity gets it. Readers will get it too.\n\nThe resolution, to family questions, to Connolly's claim of a frame and the murder trial itself, are all resolved in interesting ways and the book is ultimately properly completed.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Judy agreed to defend a man accused of murder who admits to killing--not murdering--his lifelong nemesis, in fulfillment of a vendetta. Pigeon Tony freely confesses to the crime but sees no crime in it. There are mitigating circumstances which go back to Mussolini-era Italy and reach out to a crime committed just a year before the action of the novel takes place. (Ms. Scottoline is to be applauded for vividly bringing to life this tense period.) However, none of this will matter in court if Pigeon Tony testifies, which is what he wants to do. He fails to see why he should be punished for administering a justice he so clearly sees. This is not a murder mystery so much as a \"How do you defend the murderer?\" legal thriller.\n\nAll this creates an extremely tense, frustrating and frightening case for Judy. The threats are everywhere from the aggrieved family of victim Angelo Coluzzi and its heavy-weight goon, Jimmy Bello.\n\nThe writing is fairly swift, occasionally getting bogged down with a little too much exposition into the intricacies of pigeon raising and racing. The juxtaposition of the romances--one in the 1940s and the one Judy finds herself in--is well balanced and works.\n\nSome elements didn't work so well. I found the depiction of Italians and Italian-Americans to be a bit over-the-top. (I almost expected Chico Marx and Mr. Bacciagalupe to appear.) It was far from offensive, however, because (a) some of the stereotypes are quite true (I can attest to this as an Italian-American), and (b) these characters are generally presented in a good-natured way. My last nitpick has to do with the ending of the legal component of the case which I will not give away here.\n\nStill, this is a four-star review which means I sincerely recommend the book for the many things that Ms. Scottoline achieves here.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2WSI8HOWHFDOT", "ProductID": "B000FC14DU", "Review": "The Courtroom and the Boxing Ring Early on, in Lisa Scottoline's gripping \"Mistaken Identity\", attorney Bennie Rosato reminds her associates that a defense lawyer doesn't seek justice. Justice is secondary to, if not in conflict with, loyalty to the client. As the novel progresses, however, Bennie finds her own advice hard to swallow because the client, who may or may not be her identical twin that she never knew existed, is a devious and dangerous woman, accused of murdering a policeman. Later in the book, one of Bennie's legal associates, takes boxing lessons. The advice given to her by her trainer is that if you punish the body long enough, the head will fall. This advice goes further than anyone involved in the case would have imagined. Punishing the prosecutor's case, and dogged investigation, would bring justice while maintaining loyalty--to a degree. To me, these were the central points of this tense and intense novel.\n\nMs. Scottoline does a magnificent juggling act here. Unlike most mysteries or courtroom dramas which focus on a handful of developed characters and bring in dozens of marginally described minor characters, this book is crowded with believable, three dimensional people. Besides the three women in Rosato's firm, there are the defendant and her fellow inmates; there's Rosato's boyfriend, Grady; there's a cabal of individually motivated crooked cops; there's the judge; the D.A.; a hotheaded prizefighter... the list goes on.\n\nUnfortunately, even the most accomplished jugglers will, oops, drop something. In this case, there are some unanswered questions. While mystery/courtroom novels are supposed to dangle red herrings, there were a couple that needed to be explained. Perhaps they will be addressed in later novels. Regardless, I was taken in by this book. Lisa Scottoline's \"Mistaken Identity\", like a great boxing match, has plenty of sharp jabs and some devastating punches.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Coluzzi is a rich man who is corrupt and has ties to the Mafia.\n\nDuring flashbacks in the book, we see why their ages-old feud, since their lives in Italy when Coluzzi was one of the Black Shirts, led to the killing.

Pigeon Tony was sure the killing was justified because it wasn't murder; Coluzzi killed Pigeon Tony's wife in Italy many years ago and his son and daughter-in-law more recently in Philadelphia.\n\nWhile this book wasn't a not-put-downable thriller, it was interesting and did make me want to keep reading.

This book started slow and I almost gave up on it.  To be honest, a vendetta between two old Italian men is not what I want to read about.  This novel has a lot of flashbacks to the vendetta story, regarding past injuries and injustices and the current situation involving the killing of one of the protagonists.  I gave this book a chance because I wanted to read a story with Judy Carrier as the main character.  If you've read any of the author's previous works, you know who Judy is.  In this book, we learn a little more--particularly about her work ethic.\nJudy seems to work more hours than there are in one day.  She works almost exclusively on this one case and she's not getting paid for it although she racks up some pretty hefty expenses.  There are a lot of loose ends here and a lot of items introduced but, never explained.  For example, there is a character named Murphy in Judy's office mentioned a couple of times as a \"sidebar\" and then the conflict between the two characters is never mentioned again.\nThe only character we really learn a lot about is Pigeon Tony.

In this book, (Ms.) Bennie Rosato herself enjoys the limelight occupied by her associates Mary and Judy from other stories (although they both appear with small parts herein); so it's nice we finally get to learn much more about the principal herself.  Moreover, the author baits our hook in chapter 1 that the murder defendant, Alice Connelly, may be Bennie's unknown identical twin - and appearances at a minimum seem convincing.  We're kept in limbo on this question until chapter 41 (of 44), adding a great deal of suspense to a story otherwise already pretty compelling.  Even the book's title vacillates in our minds as first a clue then a red herring re the twin mystery.  But while we get the twin question settled finally by DNA (one way or the other), unlike so many tales of this genre, several plot elements are left to further pondering at the end.  In fact, that the book ends on a situation hardly totally settled may speak to perhaps the ethical issues the Publisher often asserts is part of Scottoline's appeal.\nSo, another good member of the growing Scottoline roster (now up to 8), with all of suspense, plot, and a sophisticated ending to entertain and keep pages turning late into the night.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The premise here is that Tony Lucia (\"Pigeon Tony\", from his expertise with homing pigeon racing), on trial for murdering a life-long rival, Angelo Coluzzi, admits to the \"killing\" but not to the \"murder\".  Will the jury buy that fine line -- that somehow this death was justifiable given that Coluzzi killed Pigeon Tony's wife decades ago in Fascist Italy, and killed his son and daughter-in-law in a fake auto accident here in America, where the two families immigrated to none other than Scottoline's latest stomping ground, South Philly.\nIn the process of unfolding that story line, we get some obviously well researched description of Italy in the Mussolini era, rich with imagery and character development (eventually respun for the jury's benefit as well...).  We get glimpses of life in the Italian \"sector\" of South Philly, using Judy's stream of consciousness to make it fun as opposed to stereotypical, with Pigeon Tony's handsome grandson thrown in to (finally!) give Judy a little welcome sex life, only adding to the character development and good time had by all.  Lastly, Bennie herself adds a little to the courtroom machinations, to liven up a case that looks winnable until Pigeon Tony insists he wants to \"talk to the judge\" (testify).\nThat's why I like this book a lot -- it's a really good mix of writing ingredients, from a compelling story that you want to come out a certain way, to really good characterizations of people easy to like, with plenty of suspense and humor thrown in to really entertain throughout.  I was also pleased that some of the lapses into very implausible action (lawyers tailing criminal's cars, or fighting against their own clients) that characterized some of the earlier works in this series was finally absent from the book at hand.  Lastly, I keep hearing (I guess from the publisher's blurbs) that Lisa's books are being used for classroom debate, and I suspect this one will as well, if the legal \"mores\" angle interests you.\nSo -- sounds like a little something for everybody all wrapped up in one \"5-star\" addition to the genre.

Lisa Scottoline, Mistaken Identity (Harper, 1999)\n\nThree pages into Lisa Scottoline's sixth novel, Mistaken Identity, I wasn't sure I was going to make it to page ten. Scottoline opens the novel with her protagonist, Bennie Rosato, walking into the county prison where her newest client is in residence, mentally rattling off statistics that we've all heard a million times, most of which are, to say the least, on shaky ground as far as their worth is concerned. It is a horrible opening; thankfully, it is also short. The book improves tremedously on page four, and stays improved for the next five hundred plus pages.\n\nRosato's newest client is Alice Connolly, who greets her with the rather surprising revelation that Connolly is Rosato's twin, despite that the two have never met before. The twin thing certainly throws a few extra monkeywrenches into the works of the normal courtroom/detective story, not that it needed any. Connolly is accused of killing her live-in boyfriend, a Philadelphia police officer, and makes nasty hints that other cops are framing her. The first half of the book alternates between Rosato trying to figure out if there really is a conspiracy and trying to figure out whether Connolly actually killed her boyfriend, as the two things aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. This section is standard mystery fare; if you're a fan of the genre, it'll work for you.\n\nWhere Scottoline shines is once the case gets to court. When you reach page 300 and they're getting ready for trial, you start wondering how Scottoline is going to fill the second half of the book. She does so brilliantly, better even than many nonfiction true crime books cover trials. In fact, the only book I can think of that goes into this much detail of the trial, specifically the dialogue, is Bataille's <i>The Trial of Gilles de Rais</i> (in which the second half of the book is simply unexpurgated trial transcripts). In both Bataille's work of nonfiction and Scottoline's novel, we are given solid evidence that cutting out the supposedly extraneous material of a trial, a rather common method of speeding up books/movies/TV shows, may be good for cutting time, but that all the other stuff is going to be just as gripping to the devoted reader of courtroom-procedure books. Scottoline takes us, line by line, through a cross-examination instead of summarizing. It's wonderful. Would that more courtroom-drama authors did such things. Maybe, as Scottoline gains the audience she deserves, it'll catch on.\n\nThe beginning of the book is enough to make me drop it a notch, but still a highly recommended read. *** 1/2", "Feedback": "positive"}

This review is of the unabridged audiocassette version of The Vendetta Defense as performed by Ms. Barbara Rosenblat.\nWarm, rich, rewarding, and engaging are all adjectives that jump to mind about this masterly story of the clash of cultures, egos, and generations.  Ms. Scottoline has a rich imagination, love of her characters, and warm feelings for her readers that make this story come alive with passion, tension, and revealing emotions.\nThe character of Anthony \"Pigeon Tony\" Lucia is one of the most interesting and appealing that I have come across in many years.  He may be the most interesting defendent ever in a fictional case.  Mr. Lucia is essentially a simple man of peace, with a great respect for nature, beauty, and honesty.  Yet his natural goodness has brought him into conflict with the literal forces of darkness in the form of an ex-fascist black shirt, Angelo Coluzzi.  The two men's lives have moved in parallel orbits for over 60 years, and this story recounts how all that occurred and what the implications are for all of us.  Pigeon Tony has always sought to turn the other cheek, and has paid a large price for his acceptance of his tormentor's attentions.  Did he do the right thing?\nThe Vendetta Defense sets up many interesting conflicts to build on the basic one of good versus evil.  These contrasts include the law versus taking action as ways to solve problems, the perspectives of different generations, the views of the native-born Americans versus immigrants, Italian-Americans versus those of other national backgrounds, and seeking pleasure versus seeking goodness.  The plot is even more complicated than that, including flashbacks over Pigeon Tony's life, a complex set of legal maneuvers, physical and mental battles, and a developing relationship for Ms. Judy Carrier, Pigeon Tony's attorney, and Pigeon Tony's grandson, Frank.\nFor those who like top-notch legal conflicts in their fiction, you will like the many twists and turns of this case.  It also has a comedic flair to offset the many moments of darkest despair.  You will be reminded of the gravedigger's scene in Hamlet at several points in the book.\nMs. Rosenblat's performance is superb.  She easily makes the transition between male and female voices, people of vastly different ages, alternative accents, and a wide range of emotions.  I thoroughly enjoyed hearing her read this outstanding book.  I strongly urge you to listen to this version of the book.  You will undoubtedly enjoy the book even more than if you simply read it.\nAfter you finish The Vendetta Defense, ask yourself what you would have done at each step in the life of Pigeon Tony.

When someone kills another, is it always murder, and can such killing of another be justified? Lisa Scottoline tackles these moral and legal dilemmas in THE VENDETTA DEFENSE, her newest work. And saying it right up front, this reviewer feels that it's her best work to date.\nThe very first line of this book states that Tony Lucia killed Angelo Colluzi that morning. Pigeon Tony, as he's known to his friends, is an elderly man who gets his name from the pigeons he loves and races, as he has done all his life. He is arrested for the murder of Colluzi, who it turns out, has had a vendetta going against Pigeon Tony and his family since the days when they both lived in Italy during the Fascist era.\nThe Philadelphia law firm of Rosato and Associates will be familiar to those who have read Ms. Scottoline's previous novels. Bennie Rosato and Mary DiNunzio make appearances, but in this one Judy Carrier takes the lead role of Pigeon Tony's defense attorney against the wishes of Bennie, who is her boss. And just to further complicate issues, Judy falls in love with Pigeon Tony's grandson, Frank.\nA master at characterization, Lisa Scottoline writes about South Philadelphia, its environs and its people as if she's strolled through the streets, examining the cracks on the sidewalks, noting the walls that have peeling paint, remembering which parking meters are not functioning. Her attention to detail comes from one who has experienced the area and its people, not just imagined them. She makes one visualize her characters as real, multi-dimensional people, and not just flat caricatures.\nAnd speaking of descriptions, look out for the details about Judy Carrier's new bright green VW Beetle if you want an example of how the author pays attention to visualizations, right down to the flower in the glass bottle in the console. This is just one small example.\nAs a mystery writer, Ms. Scottoline has successfully drawn on her experiences as an attorney. She further deals with touchy legal ethical issues in this book, something she has lectured on at law schools before.\nAs in her previous novels this book is at times movingly sensitive and compassionate. At other times it is humorous, funny in a subtle way, and at other times you'll want to laugh out loud.\nI didn't think that a \"vendetta defense\" such as this was a plausible plot when I first read about it. Ms. Scottoline seems to bring her three-dimensional characters to life, and make the concept conceivable.\nIf you have come to enjoy Lisa Scottoline's writing style, her characterizations and her subtle sense of humor, then this is a book you will find to be amongst her best. And if you haven't read any of her previous works, you may want to pick up a few of them in addition to this one.\nYou won't be sorry you did!", "Feedback": "positive"}

In a series of flashbacks, we learn the story of Tony Lucia and Angelo Coluzzi.  These two men were neighbors in a small town in Italy sixty years ago, and they were rivals for the hand of the beautiful Silvana.  Silvana chose Tony Lucia over Angelo Coluzzi, and Angelo, a rabid Fascist and a vicious thug, never forgave this betrayal.

For over half a century, Tony has restrained his anguish, until the fateful day when he and Coluzzi finally have it out.  Judy Carrier, a hotshot lawyer in Bennie Rosato's all-female law firm, decides to take on Tony Lucia's seemingly hopeless case.  While trying this case, Judy risks her life, weathers exciting and nerve-wracking courtroom battles and finds love with Frank, Tony's gorgeous grandson.

The first part is little more than an emotional rant. The communist manifesto is completely untenable and unrealistic in any practical form. This is evinced since the advent of communism in Russia through every country that touts the communist ideal. This utopian idea, as Marx states himself, can only exist at the behest of a bourgeois already in existence and well developed that a proletariat might be created so that the communist philosophy may become necessary and thereby implemented. The society Marx outlines is devoid of any boundaries, towns, cities, provinces, states, counties, countries, and political parties. From its thrust into the world in Russia throughout every communist country currently in existence, not a single one of them reflects the philosophy and ideology of Marx's communism. All communist regimes are just as much a prime example of class distinction and class antagonism, albeit minus the \"right\" to publicly take any position not in line with the ruling communist class. Marx's philosophy directly opposes not only industrialization but also the advent and continued proliferation of a mechanized world. It is also a philosophy lacking any sense of values and character indemnified by Marx's open declaration that communists will ride on the back of any revolutionary movement they view as having the probability of overthrowing the ruling class of any nation regardless of that revolutionary movement's philosophy.\n\nAfter reading this the naivety of Marx and his fellow communists of his era, the progenitors of the communist philosophy, it becomes abundantly obvious that power hungry, greedy men of unbounded avarice would see the communist philosophy as a means to their ends with the window of opportunity presently afforded them at the time. These men then used the guise of communist utopia to rally men to their cause, the poorer the better, to agitate them towards violence and ride the wave of revolution to victory and the establishment of yet another government that does not also create class distinction and oppression but brutally does so. Once these men are in power the result is similar to a monarchy without the opulence. Not only all power is invested in the ruling class but also so is all the national wealth held by the ruling class, just like it is in a monarchy.\nBoundaries are not erased in any sense but are more firmly established and enforced even at the cost of death for anyone who would try to escape such a blissful existence.\n\nThe representative government authorized by a constitution is not, as no construct of men may not be, without its problems. Still, a government defined by the people of a nation, restricted by a constitution, and built upon inherent rights belonging to every human being, is far better than anything else the world had in the past or currently exercises.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Kind of an obligation to read this sort of material.\n\nIve been hearing about The Communist Manifesto\" since middle school, so I finally decided to pick up a copy [on iBooks - its in open domain] and checked it out.\n\nIts a short piece [52 pages], divided into four sections.\n\nThe first section was awesome. Its about the relationship between the working and the ruling class, and why it is as it is. It talks about such things as the dissolution of social capital into financial capital [such as in the destruction of the family for industrial means] [p7]. It talks about the fragility of the industrial economy [p8], the profit/debt cycles that drive that economy forward [p9], and globalization [p9]. It even talks about how financial capital has become a form of artificial intelligence [p12]. The inverse relationship between the repulsiveness of a job and its pay is also investigated [p13]. It talks about the homogenization of culture [p18], and the 99% [p18]. In short, its brilliant.\n\nAfter that though, the piece goes down hill. The second section outlines communism, which doesnt seem to address any of the problems outlined in the first section, except for property [p26]. Instead, it looks into centralization, something Im not a fan of. And then the third section didn't really make sense to me, because it heavily referenced current [mid 1800s] political conditions. The fourth section is simply a final call to action.\n\nIm not exactly sure why Marx understood the situation so well [his analysis is still dead on today], yet couldn't approach meaningful application.

{"ReviewerID": "A1BKWL9QFKB2EX", "ProductID": "B000FC27TA", "Review": "A sociopathic crackpot, but merely one of many Having read a number of philosophers over the decades, I have come to the conclusion that most of them are crackpots.  Especially those devoted to developing political and economic Utopias and who advocate violence to achieve them.  Karl Marx advocated the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie to implement his classless Utopia.  So one can see why Communism was  is -- so feared by wealthy Capitalists.  Inadvertently, Communism has been Capitalisms greatest ally, since it has been so blatantly demented it makes Capitalism look good in comparison.  Communism became not just a struggle with those who had unjustly appropriated the lions share, and then some, of the national wealth, it degenerated into a war against the middle class.  Which, in fact, was what the crackpot wanted.  It made it possible to equate Communism with labor unions, Socialism, and even with people fighting Colonialism for national independence.  While Capitalism depends upon exploitation of weaker people, those countries the Capitalists were exploiting understandably wanted their wealth for their own people.  As Marx asks near the beginning of the Manifesto:  Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power?  USAmerica advocated the violent overthrow of the democratically-elected leaders of such regimes, Vietnam, Chile, and Iran being salient examples, in the name of fighting godless Communism.  While apologists for Communism claim, correctly enough, that Russia and China were rather the opposite of what Marx had in mind, when hatred and violence are promoted, that is what should be expected.  One could likewise insist, correctly, that the Inquisition and the genocide of Native Americans were the opposite of what Christ had in mind.  On the other hand, they were very much what Moses and Joshua had in mind.  But thats just my pet peeve.\n\nSome of the knee-jerk Capitalist reviewers complain about all of the things Marx and Engels got wrong, usually without making specifications.  One, who wrote a very long, specific review started out by saying that Marx was made immediately obsolete because there was a wage increase in 1848.  Wow!  So the novels of John Steinbeck were based upon nothing?  The recent slaughter of garment workers in Cambodia who were striking for a living wage did not happen?  It is worth pointing out at least a few of the things that Marx got right.\n\n[Capitalism] has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  Free trade.  This is something that many Capitalisms victims (the ones who were not murdered) in Chile complain about.  For an obvious example right at home, look at the fast-food industry.  Rather than taking pride in nourishing Americas youth, they take pride in getting enormously wealthy by feeding children cheap, habit-forming junk that has made obesity one of the number one health problems in America.  And cigarette manufacturers not only fought tooth-and-nail denying that cigarettes caused cancer, even though they knew better, they added ingredients to them that made them more addictive.  I actually once defended American cigarette companies because I could not believe that they had done that.  But they did.\n\nThe need of a constantly expanding markets for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe.  It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.  Now we might add that it does this in order to find cheap labor.  Cheap labor in right wing countries (purportedly Communist countries) in which common laborers are disenfranchised from a voice in government and their complaints are violently suppressed.\n\nThere are other examples of things Marx got right, but it is pertinent to now look at a few things the crackpot Capitalist lovers-of-wisdeom got wrong.  We can start with Adam Smith, as THE WEALTH OF NATIONS is more-or-less the Bible of Laissez-Faire Capitalism.  In Smiths time it was taken for granted, as it is now in many Capitalist nations, that workers deserved no more than bare-subsistence wages.  This meant that the health conditions of the poor were such that about 50% of their children died, so they had to be paid at least this much to insure a continuing supply of workers.  To be sure, medicine was so primitive in those days that even the children of the middle class and wealthy died in alarming numbers, but it was clearly much worse for the poor.  One could even reasonably argue that the wealthier people might have been healthier if the poor had been better maintained.  At any rate, having a large population of extremely impoverished people provides fertile ground for crackpot Communism.  (At the present time, over 50% pf the worlds population lives on less than $2.00/day, and the population will double in about 40 years.  But there is no reason for crackpot Capitalists to be nervous).  Smith is famous for his invisible hand conjecture.  It is not a theory; lets use correct terminology here.  This sounds a lot like mysticism, or wishful thinking, and history has repeatedly demonstrated that it is just that.  Admittedly, that assessment differs from that of the few people who have become extraordinarily wealthy as a consequence of it, but that isn't that many people.\n\nJohn Locke preceded Smith as Capitalist apologist, in the days when mercantilism was morphing into capitalism.  His great contribution was to argue that even though in the olden days no one had any right to acquire excess land because the goods produced on that land would spoil, the advent of money made it morally right for one person to acquire all the land that he could.  He then argued that money had been implicit in human nature from the very beginning, and therefore Capitalism was harmonious with human nature.  Property is everyones God-given right, but the only property landless people have is their own labor.  When they sell this labor to support themselves, they are no longer independent.  Only independent people are capable of rationality, and only rational people are capable of participating in government.  Ergo, workers are incapable of rationality and have no right to participate in government.  This reasoning is so blatantly spurious it should not require refutation.  Nor would refutation even be possible for anyone unreasonable enough to believe it.\nAyn Rand is The Goddess of the Market, as Jennifer Burns refers to her in her excellent biography.  Alan Greenspan was her disciple, who was once, before the crash, touted as the rock star of economics.  Despite the fact that her novels depict people no more believable than those found in a Doc Savage thriller, and contain rambling, lengthy soliloquies impenetrably dull and replete with spurious logic that only the blindly faithful can wade through, she is considered by her devotees, as one of the outstanding writers of the 20th Century.  She calls her philosophy objectivism, even though it is obviously unmitigated subjectivism.  Selfishness is a virtue, although she pretends that selfishness has a different meaning than it actually has.  Looking out for ones own interest will naturally lead to what is best for everybody, so that is the ultimate morality.  Fair wages, she maintains, are determined by the market, so striking for living wages can only be detrimental, even for the people doing the striking.  Paying $36,000 for a wrist watch in a country where workers make $100/month (about 0.60/hour) is a distribution of wealth fairly determined by the market place.  It goes without saying that she is opposed to health care, and also to public education.  Ignorant people are more easily manipulated.  Though Rand and her ilk talk constantly of freedom, it is the freedom of the market they want, not of people.  When Rand praises America as the first moral nation, it is not because of its democracy, a word she never uses.  Largely thanks to her efforts, American has been devoured by the wealthy.\n\nSince 1999, after the economic meltdown, the suicide rate for older white men has risen from 20,000 per year to about 30,000 per year in 2013.  Despite this, successful Capitalists typically insist that Capitalism is the economic system most in harmony with human nature.  From this one must conclude that they believe that suicidal despair is in harmony with human nature.  Moreover, it is also human nature to be easily manipulated.  Capitalism heavily relies upon this human trait, though not more so than feudalism, mercantilism, Christianity and all other religions, Nazism, Communism, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, the Crips and the Bloods, etc.  However, there are those of us who believe that this all-too-human trait of being easily manipulated is merely what we are taught.  Since the people in power always rely upon an easily manipulated populace, this is what people have always been taught.  But a populace of easily-manipulated people can easily be manipulated against those in power by ruthless men with their own agenda, so a society of people easily swayed by passionate pseudo-reasoning can never be stable.  A genuine education should be geared toward teaching people not to be easily manipulated.  There is no reason why this should not be possible.  Since civilization has been around for 10,000 years or so, it would be a good idea to finally get around to giving it a try.  Ill bet that Christ would approve.\n\nYes, Marx was wrong in many ways, but that does not mean that Capitalism is right.  The difference between Communism and Socialism, I never tire of pointing out, is that Communism believe that a violent revolution will be necessary to achieve a more equitable distribution of national wealth; Socialists believe that a more equitable distribution of national wealth must be achieved to prevent that from happening.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

After the time of the Renaissance and glorious revolution of France, when the peasants rose up in revolt because of hunger, due to national debt that the king and the government couldn't get it together and finally lost his head over it.  The Public Safety Committee takes off his head, Robespierre takes over and begin beheading everyone that disagreed with them to the point that poetic justice took off his head after he beheaded  approximately 20,000 heads a year during his reign of terror.  A lot like the Bolshevik revolution when Lenin came back from Switzerland, killed Nicholas II and his whole family, including the children, furthering more killings of innocent peasants as the Tsar had before he executed him and his family.  Like France which started a revolution for more democracy and received another dictator in Robespierre and  Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nKarl Marx writes like the philosophers before the Renaissance, like them, he rambles on with rhetoric that rambles on with bad writing grammar  over explaining his theories.  His rambling rhetoric literary technique in prose would drive a maggot crazy, but is worth the education to plow through it.  His philosophy is full of take from the rich and give to the poor.  If Marxism isn't the answer what is, because some of the principles are good, free college education for our children and let capitalism work with less and our nation wouldn't fall behind the rest of the world as illiterate.  We ask why our children don't go to college, because after they get good paying jobs they spend twenty years paying off student loans, we discourage our children from going to college.  In this Karl Marx is right, the rich can afford to send their kids to college but the poor can't, keeping their descendants poor too, and crippling  the enhancement of the skills of our nations.  As you read the Communist Manifesto and see the shape of our nation today we can see ourselves through the present political policies moving toward Marxism and maybe a revolution of sort.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

If one accepts the basic assumptions made early in Chapter 1 of Capital, Volume 1--that abstract labor is the source of value(1)--Marx's logic flows well, not only through Volume 1, but all the way through Volume 3.\n\nIf one is looking to fault Marx's economics based on the works of Capital, one will come up empty not only because Marx's logic is flawless, but as economist and former Marxist Thomas Sowell says, \" ...Marx considered the idea of proving a concept to be ridiculous. Moreover, Engels had asserted...that one only proves one's ignorance of dialectics by thinking of it as a means by which things can be proved.\"(2)\n\nHowever, there was one instance where Marx let his dialectical guard down, allowing for an empirical objection that would consign all of Marx's works for naught. Sowell himself touches upon the specific passage where Marx cornered himself, but doesn't appreciate the full ramifications of Marx's observation.\n\nIn the \"The Poverty of Philosophy\" (1847) Marx says, \"In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social relations. The handmill [a productive force] gives you society with the feudal lord, the steam-mill [a productive force], society with the industrial capitalist.\"(3)\n\nSowell argues regarding Marx's handmill/steam-mill analogy, \"If read literally, these words suggest a one-way causation and explanation of given states of being rather than of transformation. But that is clearly inconsistent both with Marx's and Engels' own treatment of history and with the dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction. These words are perhaps best read as epigrams-and of the dangers of misunderstanding inherent in that writing style.\"(4)\n\nIs Sowell correct? Was Marx merely being terse with his handmill/steam-mill analogy?\n\nWhile Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a \"dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction\", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations? Marx was emphatic that machines came first, then all else followed them. In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor,(5) Marx writes:\n\n\"Thus it is slapping history in the face to want to begin by the division of labor in general, in order to get subsequently to a specific instrument of production, machinery.\n\nMachinery is no more an economic category than the bullock that drags the plough. Machinery is merely a productive force. The modern workshop, which depends on the application of machinery, is a social production relation, an economic category.\"(6)\n\nThe problem with this empirical observation is that before there was a steam mill there already existed an industrial capitalist society that not only contained the requisite industrial capitalist mode of production that manufactured the necessary constituent parts that went into the creation of the steam mill (there were many companies involved in the problem-solving for and manufacture of components that went into a steam engine), but this pre-steam mill society also contained an already sophisticated industrial capitalist labor force that made the constituent parts for the steam mill, not to mention built the steam mill itself. Contemporaneous with the industrial capitalist production of steam engines, there existed the production of the machines that the steam engines would power. In other words, the steam mill presupposes an already functioning industrial capitalist society! Marx's rebuke to Proudhon is a tautological response that also fails to recognize that a steam engine is made up of independently manufactured parts that predates the manufacture of a steam engine with those independently manufactured parts! Marx fails to mention this double inconsistency with his material \"productive forces\" empirical observation.\n\nSimplified, Marx is speaking of the root cause for industrial Capitalism...the steam engine, but that beginning of industrial Capitalism only exists to the extent of (1) the already existing industrial Capitalist division of labor that manufactured the component parts for the steam engine; (2) the already existing industrial Capitalist capital goods/intermediate goods industries that manufactured the constituent parts that went into the construction of the steam engine; (3) the already existing industrial Capitalist capital goods/intermediate goods industries that manufactured the machines that the steam engine powers; and (4) an already existing industrial Capitalist division of labor that manufactures those machines powered by the steam engine!\n\nWhen the first steam-mill was completed supposedly, according to Marx, 'giving' a society with industrial Capitalism, in fact industrial Capitalism, and an industrial Capitalist division of labor, already existed, and would have to already be in existence otherwise there could be no steam-mills and the machines they were created to power!\n\nMarx behaves like a child throwing a tantrum: Machines come first, then all else follows. Why? Because Marx said so, even though the historical record says otherwise!\n\nIn fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism couldn't have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based, interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.\n\nDuring the Mercantilist era low interest rates ensured that only consumption-based investments could take place, such investments requiring relatively little capital expenditures, such low capital expenditures being a function of the expected return on the investment, which return is based on the low interest rate policy being followed by Mercantilist nations. Industrial ventures, on the other hand, require large expenditures of capital, such amounts only made possible by a higher rate of return that can recoup the larger capital outlay, a higher rate of return that is made possible only with higher, market-based, interest rates.\n\nWe therefore see that not only was it necessary to already have an existing industrial Capitalist division of labor before machines made their appearance, there also needed to be in existence the requisite financing for the new machines to come into existence, meaning a new industrial Capitalist financial setup (where market-based, higher, interest rates are the norm) was a necessary precursor for the emergence of industrial Capitalism.\n------------------------------\n(see first comment for available links to titles cited)\n\n1.

Yes, they should equal the POTENTIAL value of their labor.\n\nNow, since actual labor is required for there to be potential value, and there is no actual labor to speak of, then the potential imputation of labor value into machines/commodities is zero, and therefore Marx's Law of Value is in error.\n\nIn fact, the proof affirms that imputation of a commodity's value can't be anything physical, it must be subjective...that is in the mind of the observer.\n--------------------------------------\nAddendum (July 18, 2014):\n\nThe following nicely illustrates how net (new) investment (productivity increases) took place before medium of exchange, while (1) also illustrating how such net (new) investments spurred trade between separated communities; and (2) clarifying Marx's confusion as to what came first to alter social relations, (i) machines; or (ii) something else preceding machines...\n\nTribe A saved more by looking for food less, placing that saved time into creating a net that would increase the catch of fish. We can say that Tribe A has a greater productive edge than does Tribe B, whose members are still using sharpened sticks to catch fish--very laborious and relatively unproductive.\n\nNow Tribe A decides, due to its higher productivity/wealth, it can afford to save more time, adding this saved time to the saved time it used for making fishing nets, and build a boat that will allow their nets to catch even more fish. Being busy building boats, Tribe A allows Tribe B to build the nets--a less productive venture than the new boat-building venture is. Tribe A's greater productivity thanks to fishing boats (and greater wealth thanks to fishing boats) allows for more children, increasing the tribe's population, allowing for a larger labor supply in the near future that will be available for procuring other innovative, labor-saving inventions.\n\nIn the modern economy the money we save is the \"saved time\" that Tribe A used to construct nets/boats, but since the rate of interest is being intentionally kept low by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, there can be no new capital formation (money that's used for new long-term productive investments) in Western economies (nor Japan) for new productive ventures, because the lure for such new investments--the higher rate of return that higher, market-based, interest rates offer--is non-existent; the central bank mandated low interest rate policy won't cover the loan on the massive outlay of capital that net (new) productive projects require.\n\nBy the way, notice what comes first in the above illustration, contradicting Marx's claim that the \"material productive forces\" (machines) are the INITIAL venue by which societies alter their values/relationships...people had to \"save time\" FIRST by curtailing their quest for food.* Now in the modern economy, where money is used, FIRST comes the necessity of market-based interest rates that allows for the accumulation of capital that THEN produces the labor-saving machines! The higher the market-based interest rate, the better for capital accumulation.\n-----------------------------------\n*Incredibly, Marx was unaware (or more likely, deluded himself into unawareness) of this critical sequence.", "Feedback": "negative"}

If one accepts the basic assumptions made early in Chapter 1 of Capital, Volume 1--that abstract labor is the source of value(1)--Marx's logic flows well, not only through Volume 1, but all the way through Volume 3.\n\nIf one is looking to fault Marx's economics based on the works of Capital, one will come up empty not only because Marx's logic is flawless, but as economist and former Marxist Thomas Sowell says, \" ...Marx considered the idea of proving a concept to be ridiculous. Moreover, Engels had asserted...that one only proves one's ignorance of dialectics by thinking of it as a means by which things can be proved.\"(2)\n\nHowever, there was one instance where Marx let his dialectical guard down, allowing for an empirical objection that would consign all of Marx's works for naught. Sowell himself touches upon the specific passage where Marx cornered himself, but doesn't appreciate the full ramifications of Marx's observation.\n\nIn the \"The Poverty of Philosophy\" (1847) Marx says, \"In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social relations. The handmill [a productive force] gives you society with the feudal lord, the steam-mill [a productive force], society with the industrial capitalist.\"(3)\n\nSowell argues regarding Marx's handmill/steam-mill analogy, \"If read literally, these words suggest a one-way causation and explanation of given states of being rather than of transformation. But that is clearly inconsistent both with Marx's and Engels' own treatment of history and with the dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction. These words are perhaps best read as epigrams-and of the dangers of misunderstanding inherent in that writing style.\"(4)\n\nIs Sowell correct? Was Marx merely being terse with his handmill/steam-mill analogy?\n\nWhile Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a \"dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction\", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations? Marx was emphatic that machines came first, then all else followed them. In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor,(5) Marx writes:\n\n\"Thus it is slapping history in the face to want to begin by the division of labor in general, in order to get subsequently to a specific instrument of production, machinery.\n\nMachinery is no more an economic category than the bullock that drags the plough. Machinery is merely a productive force. The modern workshop, which depends on the application of machinery, is a social production relation, an economic category.\"(6)\n\nThe problem with this empirical observation is that before there was a steam mill there already existed an industrial capitalist society that not only contained the requisite industrial capitalist mode of production that manufactured the necessary constituent parts that went into the creation of the steam mill (there were many companies involved in the problem-solving for and manufacture of components that went into a steam engine), but this pre-steam mill society also contained an already sophisticated industrial capitalist labor force that made the constituent parts for the steam mill, not to mention built the steam mill itself. Contemporaneous with the industrial capitalist production of steam engines, there existed the production of the machines that the steam engines would power. In other words, the steam mill presupposes an already functioning industrial capitalist society! Marx's rebuke to Proudhon is a tautological response that also fails to recognize that a steam engine is made up of independently manufactured parts that predates the manufacture of a steam engine with those independently manufactured parts! Marx fails to mention this double inconsistency with his material \"productive forces\" empirical observation.\n\nSimplified, Marx is speaking of the root cause for industrial Capitalism...the steam engine, but that beginning of industrial Capitalism only exists to the extent of (1) the already existing industrial Capitalist division of labor that manufactured the component parts for the steam engine; (2) the already existing industrial Capitalist capital goods/intermediate goods industries that manufactured the constituent parts that went into the construction of the steam engine; (3) the already existing industrial Capitalist capital goods/intermediate goods industries that manufactured the machines that the steam engine powers; and (4) an already existing industrial Capitalist division of labor that manufactures those machines powered by the steam engine!\n\nWhen the first steam-mill was completed supposedly, according to Marx, 'giving' a society with industrial Capitalism, in fact industrial Capitalism, and an industrial Capitalist division of labor, already existed, and would have to already be in existence otherwise there could be no steam-mills and the machines they were created to power!\n\nMarx behaves like a child throwing a tantrum: Machines come first, then all else follows. Why? Because Marx said so, even though the historical record says otherwise!\n\nIn fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism couldn't have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based, interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.\n\nDuring the Mercantilist era low interest rates ensured that only consumption-based investments could take place, such investments requiring relatively little capital expenditures, such low capital expenditures being a function of the expected return on the investment, which return is based on the low interest rate policy being followed by Mercantilist nations. Industrial ventures, on the other hand, require large expenditures of capital, such amounts only made possible by a higher rate of return that can recoup the larger capital outlay, a higher rate of return that is made possible only with higher, market-based, interest rates.\n\nWe therefore see that not only was it necessary to already have an existing industrial Capitalist division of labor before machines made their appearance, there also needed to be in existence the requisite financing for the new machines to come into existence, meaning a new industrial Capitalist financial setup (where market-based, higher, interest rates are the norm) was a necessary precursor for the emergence of industrial Capitalism.\n------------------------------\n(see first comment for available links to titles cited)\n\n1.

As editor, Bates published some of his own stories, using the pen name Anthony Gilmore, but Gilmore's stories, most notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hawk-Carse/dp/B004TRN8IG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hawk Carse</a>, were as unsophisticated as the rest of what he published.\n\nUnder Bates's successors as editors of Astounding, Orville Tremaine (1933-1937) and, especially, John Campbell (1937-1971), science fiction became much more sophisticated and idea-oriented, and, after Bates stopped editing Astounding, his own writing matured along with the field. This anthology collects two stories Bates wrote for Tremaine, \"A Matter of Size\" (1934) and \"Alas, All Thinking\" (1935), and one he wrote for Campbell, \"Farewell to the Master\" (1940).\n\nThe blurb for this book describes all three stories as \"novellas,\" but only \"A Matter of Size\" is that long; the other two are novelettes. The Kindle edition has a few typos, nothing too annoying, but has no linked table of contents and prints the stories in reverse chronological order.\n\n\"A Matter of Size\" still has elements of early 1930s space adventure, but is more intelligently written than Bates's earlier Gilmore stories. In part of the story, the hero is shrunk by malign aliens to a height of six inches, and some of the perils he faces (including a suddenly-deadly housecat) prefigure the adventures of the hero of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Shrinking-Man-RosettaBooks-into-Film/dp/B00514HEHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Shrinking Man (RosettaBooks into Film)</a>.\n\n\"Alas, All Thinking\" moves closer to the Golden Age style of SF; it is a story of ideas, not action, and the idea was an unusually pessimistic one for 1930s SF: a time-traveller visits the future and discovers that humanity has not progressed, but rather degenerated into helpless, huge-brained beings who do nothing but meditate on ideas that prove to be useless.\n\n\"Farewell to the Master\" is a good example of Golden Age SF, balancing ideas and action. The story was the basis for the movie \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" but the movie took only a few incidents from the story. Bates's novelette does not have the anti-war message of the movie, but it has a nice twist ending that the movie did not use.\n\nThese three stories are good reading in their own right, if a bit dated by modern standards, and are also interesting illustrations of the way the SF field progressed in the 1930s.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The reader is taken through the history of origination of Communism with emphasis on the need to stabilize the living standards of the people of the world under one common principle of equality.\nSome basic principles of Communism like abolition of private property acquiring rights, abolition of inheritance rights and nationalization of production are worth noting down. The emergence of the powerful Bourgeois (middle class) from the feudal lordship and its dominance over a period of time leading to subjugation of the Proletarian (working class) has given a new meaning to Communist ideology.\nThe major aim of Communism is to raise the Proletarian to the stage of political ruling class thus overthrowing the Bourgeois supremacy. The Communists therefore support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things in the Bourgeois society.\nThe reader might not understand many terms used by the authors unless and until he has an idea about the economic scenario of his country.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed.\"\n\nThe Communist Manifesto covers a very large amount of information in a very short amount of time. This inevitably means that the statements made are not fully supported, but this is not the point of a manifesto, the purpose of which is to powerfully and coherently state a set of goals for a particular party.\n\nI think the first part of the manifesto was the most interesting. In it a unique (but brief) evaluation of history is given, with Marx's famous \"class struggle\" statement. It is concluded that all antagonisms and conflicts in history have their root in class warfare (nobleman and serf, freeman and slave, etc.) Up until Marx's time, each epoch in history had many different classes, and each time a lower classes would rebel against the upper class minority, the only thing accomplished would be a reconstructed class system with the same root problem. Marx says that in the 19th century, we have the opportunity to completely do away with the class system altogether due to the fact that this is the only time in history where the classes are so distinct: the proletariat (working class majority) and the bourgeoisie (minority that controls most of the capital due to the labor of the working class). Marx says that if the proletariat is able to overthrow the corrupt and exploitative bourgeoisie, unlike all earlier revolutions, there will be a complete transformation in society rather than simply a new reorganization due to the fact that there will be only one class - the proletariat. This means the problem of class antagonism that has so bloodied history would be over.\n\nAfter explaining how history has progressed and contrasting earlier epochs with the 19th century, the manifesto goes into a compelling critique of capitalist society. Essentially it is said that capitalism has reduced all that is good and noble in the world to the mere accumulation of profit. People are no longer seen as people; they are simply machines to increase labor and thus increase capital. A person's worth is only measured by how much capital he can produce for the ruling bourgeoisie. This is an extremely convincing anti capitalist argument, but it doesn't quite hold up to modern standards. In our time, the proletariat is not exploited anywhere near as horribly as they were in Marx's time. We now have worker unions, worker's rights, shorter workdays, labor limits, laws preventing child labor, safety regulations, higher minimum wage, etc. This was apparently not the case in 1847. One of Marx's biggest problems with capitalism was that only a small minority of bourgeoisie controlled all of the property, while the vast majority proletariat had nothing even though they do all the work. This is not the case today, where most people in industrialized societies have plenty of property for themselves. To me, this is the major reason why The Communist Manifesto does not hold up to modern times (but it couldn't be expected to).\n\nThe next part (chapter II) of the manifesto is Marx's illustration of an economic system where all are equals and no one's labor is exploited for the profits of others - communism. I do not have the requisite understanding of economics to say how viable or nonviable communism is compared with capitalism or socialism. I will say that Marx does make communism sound quite appealing. As said earlier, there are no classes in communism so everyone is equal. Labor is not performed simply for profit of a few but for the benefit of all. There is no government controlling what is done in society; the people rule themselves and perform based on the needs of all. The main argument I hear against this system is that with no private property to obtain, there is no incentive to work. Marx counters this by saying the proletariat never had any property to begin with and yet they still worked. Communism is a very utopian idea where everyone works together for the equal good of everyone, no one benefiting more than any other. I don't know how viable this can possibly be seeing as how history has given us no example where someone does not try to take power in order to exploit the weak. In fact, this is exactly what we've seen with the regimes in the 20th century that tried to implement a communist economy - far from a society with no ruling class, they become totalitarian regimes with only a few controlling all the property - exactly what Marx criticised about capitalism. Again, I will leave it to the economists to discuss the most viable economic systems.\n\nNext (chapter III) comes Marx's brief outline and critique of other socialist literature. I did not take away much from this section as it seems that Marx took it as a given that his readers would already be familiar with these various positions, and went straight into the critique without actually explaining what it was he was critiquing. You can somewhat figure out the positions simply based on the critique, but, as mentioned, the critiques are brief and I was still left somewhat lost. A comparison would be reading 19th century critiques of opposing theories to biological evolution without ever having heard of these opposing theories due to evolution being the only accepted theory in our time. This is not so much a knock on the manifesto, since Marx was clearly writing for his contemporaries, but even so things like this throughout the book take away some enjoyment and add confusion.\n\nChapter IV, the last chapter, is a very short annunciation of the relationship of communism to other movements in various countries, ending with a vigorating call to arms for the working class.\n\nI give the manifesto three stars for two reasons: one being that, as mentioned before, many of the critiques of capitalism do not hold much weight 150+ years later, reducing the manifesto's economic value to merely that of historical significance. The second reason being that even the historical significance will be reduced if the reader does not have at least moderate knowledge of European history, particularly that of the 17th and 18th centuries. In fact, the first time I read the manifesto I wasn't able to take much of anything away from it. I read it a second time after I took four college economics classes and a few history classes and was able to comprehend about 80% of it. Despite these complaints, it is still highly recommended.\n\n\"All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away; all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind.\"", "Feedback": "moderate"}

A comparison would be reading 19th century critiques of opposing theories to biological evolution without ever having heard of these opposing theories due to evolution being the only accepted theory in our time.

In fact, the first time I read the manifesto I wasn't able to take much of anything away from it.

In it a unique (but brief) evaluation of history is given, with Marx's famous \"class struggle\" statement. It is concluded that all antagonisms and conflicts in history have their root in class warfare (nobleman and serf, freeman and slave, etc.) Up until Marx's time, each epoch in history had many different classes, and each time a lower classes would rebel against the upper class minority, the only thing accomplished would be a reconstructed class system with the same root problem. Marx says that in the 19th century, we have the opportunity to completely do away with the class system altogether due to the fact that this is the only time in history where the classes are so distinct: the proletariat (working class majority) and the bourgeoisie (minority that controls most of the capital due to the labor of the working class). Marx says that if the proletariat is able to overthrow the corrupt and exploitative bourgeoisie, unlike all earlier revolutions, there will be a complete transformation in society rather than simply a new reorganization due to the fact that there will be only one class - the proletariat. This means the problem of class antagonism that has so bloodied history would be over.\n\nAfter explaining how history has progressed and contrasting earlier epochs with the 19th century, the manifesto goes into a compelling critique of capitalist society. Essentially it is said that capitalism has reduced all that is good and noble in the world to the mere accumulation of profit. People are no longer seen as people; they are simply machines to increase labor and thus increase capital. A person's worth is only measured by how much capital he can produce for the ruling bourgeoisie. This is an extremely convincing anti capitalist argument, but it doesn't quite hold up to modern standards. In our time, the proletariat is not exploited anywhere near as horribly as they were in Marx's time. We now have worker unions, worker's rights, shorter workdays, labor limits, laws preventing child labor, safety regulations, higher minimum wage, etc. This was apparently not the case in 1847. One of Marx's biggest problems with capitalism was that only a small minority of bourgeoisie controlled all of the property, while the vast majority proletariat had nothing even though they do all the work. This is not the case today, where most people in industrialized societies have plenty of property for themselves. To me, this is the major reason why The Communist Manifesto does not hold up to modern times (but it couldn't be expected to).\n\nThe next part (chapter II) of the manifesto is Marx's illustration of an economic system where all are equals and no one's labor is exploited for the profits of others - communism. I do not have the requisite understanding of economics to say how viable or nonviable communism is compared with capitalism or socialism. I will say that Marx does make communism sound quite appealing. As said earlier, there are no classes in communism so everyone is equal. Labor is not performed simply for profit of a few but for the benefit of all. There is no government controlling what is done in society; the people rule themselves and perform based on the needs of all. The main argument I hear against this system is that with no private property to obtain, there is no incentive to work. Marx counters this by saying the proletariat never had any property to begin with and yet they still worked. Communism is a very utopian idea where everyone works together for the equal good of everyone, no one benefiting more than any other. I don't know how viable this can possibly be seeing as how history has given us no example where someone does not try to take power in order to exploit the weak. In fact, this is exactly what we've seen with the regimes in the 20th century that tried to implement a communist economy - far from a society with no ruling class, they become totalitarian regimes with only a few controlling all the property - exactly what Marx criticised about capitalism. Again, I will leave it to the economists to discuss the most viable economic systems.\n\nNext (chapter III) comes Marx's brief outline and critique of other socialist literature.

They don't like technology, adopting the luddite position that it makes everything worse. They believe technology makes workers redundant and take less joy in their work. Before I go any further, does anyone agree with this nonsense? It's like they want to freeze time indefinitely, they're so anti-progress! So far, so dumb.\n\nTheir anti-machine spiel continues as they fume that the bourgeois are in control of the machines and therefore the direction the world is taking. They want the working class to control this instead. So it's just one group of society jealous of what another group of society have. Nothing revolutionary here.\n\nI had to include this quote from the manifesto as I found it ironic - \"He (the working man) becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him.\" Ironic as they claim this is the state of the working man under bourgeois rule but this is ultimately what would happen to countless millions under communist rule in the 20th century.\n\nThe manifesto contains largely sweeping statements that aren't backed up with examples or facts, and bizarre statements about the communist utopia that go along the lines of \"if everyone were communist then there would be no competition and nobody would be better and so there would be no war\". There's a lot of this \"anti-competition\" sentiment in the manifesto as apparently we should all be equal and competition means some would be better than others. And all the even weirder stuff about all private property is abolished - those so-called reasons behind that argument make no sense at all.\n\nI think besides the idealistic posturing, behind which there are no practicalities for how to bring about their \"utopia\". I mean who is to oversee that everyone does a certain job or where all products of production are directed, etc. etc.? There is very little of substance here. But then it's aimed at the 19th century working classes who, especially at this time, were very poorly educated, if at all, and so they wouldn't have the critical thinking to dissect the propaganda and lack of pragmatism that the manifesto contains, they would simply swallow the message of \"bourgeois bad, working class good, we will make the working class have better living standards\". Like a politician, all style, no substance.\n\nAnd ultimately the manifesto was used as a tool for a whole new group of people to enslave the same people while taking the wealth for themselves. Look at the legacy that the 20th century left us - two failed ideologies, fascism and communism. And yet when you look at the two, in practice they weren't that different. Communist Russia, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, all became totalitarian regimes under the guise that they were doing it all for the working man. That may not have been Marx and Engels' plan but that was certainly what happened and their convincing (to others that is, I certainly wasn't convinced by any of the empty arguments) arguments led millions of people to their deaths and inadvertently changed the world for the worse, hence my view that \"The Communist Manifesto\" is demonstrably not a great idea. Their utopia was like all utopias: a mirage and nothing more.\n\nAs for the rest of the manifesto, it talks a lot about different kinds of communists which was dull, it repeats the word \"bourgeois\" far too often (but then this is a propaganda leaflet so they had to hammer home the message that property and individual freedoms are bad), though there are moments of strangely poetic writing such as \"the robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe...\" (p. 42).\n\nI found it quite a chore to read but necessary as it's a document that has had an inordinate amount of impact on our world and it's communist ideas continue to brainwash the people of North Korea and Cuba (both third world countries led by dictators). I'm glad I read it too because I learned that sometimes ideas that are meant to be beneficial to mankind can be subverted by others to exploit people and change the stated purpose to something completely different, like Nietzsches' \"Superman\" theory with Hitler's Nazi party.\n\nIt's an interesting historical document, competently written, but don't expect revelations in the text or well thought out ideas.

{"ReviewerID": "A3TO3AY1UFM83U", "ProductID": "B000FC27TA", "Review": "Descriptively Accurate But Unduly Sanguine Marx and Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto in 1848 at the request of the Communist League, a secret association of workers driven underground by political oppression aimed at preventing concerted revolutionary activity against bourgeois regimes throughout Europe.  The Manifesto was written to provide a theoretical foundation and a practical program for the advancement of international communism and eventual elimination of bourgeois domination of property-less wage laborers.\n\nThe title of the document, simple and purely descriptive though it is, is commonly regarded as inflammatory, arousing derision, disdain, and virulent hostility among many, including those whom it was written to benefit.  Nevertheless, there is much in the Manifesto, especially in the first chapter, that with the aid of hindsight could have been written by a contemporary neo-conservative intellectual, someone like Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell.\n\nSpecifically, Marx and Engels begin with a tribute to the unparalleled productive capacity of the capitalist organization of production.  They freely laud the technological innovations fostered by capitalists' pursuit of surplus value, a process that has dramatically transformed the forces of production and the social relations of production.  The result has been rapidly expanding output of industrial and agricultural goods of all kinds.\n\nIn accomplishing this, capital has extended its markets beyond national borders, creating a world market and a world economy.  Raw materials from Latin America, Africa, and Asia are routinely used to manufacture finished goods in England, Germany, and other European countries.  The same manufactured goods may then be sold in the very places that supplied the raw materials.\n\nAll this, Marx and Engels observe, requires concentration of vast numbers of people in swollen industrial cities.  Small manufacturers and family farms are swallowed up by larger enterprises with which they have neither the capital nor productive capacity to compete.  Marx and Engels find it particularly noteworthy that men like Thomas Jefferson had envisioned America as a land of independent yeoman farmers with small land holdings, but the concentration of agriculture was rendering this vision obsolete.\n\nAs we get farther into this brief document, Daniel Bell, the other neo-conservatives, and people generally may take angry exception to its tone and substance.\n\nConcentration of resources in capital-intensive enterprises, Marx and Engels argue, reduces the vast majority of people to the degraded status of wage labor, workers who own nothing but their labor power.  It is in the interests of the bourgeoisie -- of capital -- to pay workers as little as possible, increasing surplus value by buying labor power for no more than its natural price, the amount needed to survive and reproduce.\n\nThe culture of workers is nothing more than a brutalizing culture of production, lacking in scope and richness due to the pitifully small part that each worker plays in the overall production process.  Families of working people are men, women, and children who labor for the natural price and have little time, energy or emotional sustenance to offer each other, having been wrung dry by capital's conditions of employment.\n\nThe more productive the worker, the more he or she strengthens the hand of capital.  However, capital's immense productive power and its success in keeping wage rates abysmally low are not an unmixed blessing for the bourgeoisie.  Periodic over-production crises wreck havoc with national and international markets, undercutting profits and threatening the commanding position of capital.  As a timely example, the U.S. economy is currently approximating an over-production crisis:  unemployment is high, wages are low and falling, capital has roughly two and a half trillion dollars to invest, but in the absence of demand the bourgeoisie has become risk averse, and money is not being invested in productive endeavors.\n\nThe long-term solution to all this, for Marx and Engels, is elimination of bourgeois property and the property relations that capitalism has created.  This is not to say that private property must altogether disappear, but private property as capital, as that which creates a two-class system of exploitation of labor by the bourgeoisie, certainly must cease to exist.\n\nMarx and Engels were entirely too sanguine about the eventual joining together of members of the working class to present a united front in their conflict with capital.  They realized that there were ethnic, racial, religious, national, linguistic, occupational, and other barriers that would be difficult to overcome, but I doubt they expected the workers of the world to be as fractionated as is currently the case.  If Marx and Engels were alive today, they might take the view that things would have to get much worse for labor before a revolution becames possible.\n\nIf you're not inclined to read the Manifesto, just read the introductory remarks by Vladimir Posner, once a member of the Communist Party of the USSR.  Posner spent much of his childhood and adolescence in the West, and his insights into the appeal of communist ideals and the failure of the USSR to develop communism as Marx and Engels sketchily envisioned it are extremely interesting.  Posner is no apologist for anything, just an honest and intelligent journalist whose idealism is genuine but far from boundless or excessive.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A3QN1SJPR6L552", "ProductID": "B000FC27TA", "Review": "A must read, but not necessarily a must like Though originally written in 1848, The Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels ended up exerting its greatest influence in the following century. No other book had a more profound effect on 20th-century history in terms of lives affected, governments overthrown, nations transformed, people killed or displaced, and the expenditure of time, money, and energy either for or against it. Given the fact that America was so preoccupied with the threat of Communism for decades, it's surprising how few Americans ever took the time to read the actual battle cry of their nemesis. Due to its historical importance, Communism is a political philosophy that must either be accepted or refuted, but cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, my intention here is not to critique Communism as a philosophy but rather to critique the Manifesto as a book.\n\nA common misconception is that this book is the founding document of Communism, but in reality Communism was well-known as an active political school in Europe at the time the Manifesto was published. The purpose of the Manifesto was to ignite and unite the faithful, recruit the curious, and frighten the bourgeoisie. The authors assumed a prior knowledge of Communism on the part of the reader, and as such the text spends more time clarifying the doctrine of Communism  than it does declaring it outright. Because it's a manifesto rather than a full-fledged philosophical treatise, its full of bold, undefended statements. Here you won't find well-reasoned arguments extolling the virtues of Communism, nor detailed explanations as to how exactly the world would be run following the triumph of the Revolution. For that you'll have to look elsewhere in Marx's oeuvre. The subject matter of the Manifesto is restricted to a description of the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, along with some general statements about the abolition of private property. There's also some discussion of how Communism differs from earlier forms of Socialism, and the state of its activity in Europe in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe Kindle file that's offered for free on Amazon was originally created by Project Gutenberg. It's a very short file, and one-fifth of it is taken up by the Project Gutenberg license agreement. The entire Manifesto can be read in under an hour. This is a no-frills file; it contains no introduction, commentary, or footnotes. There's no table of contents, but a file this small doesn't really need one. The English translation is from the 1888 edition edited by Engels. For the modern audience it's a bit of a clunky read. There are a few grammatical errors, subject-verb disagreements for example. Absent from this volume, however, are the annoying typographical errors often found in Project Gutenberg files created by optical character recognition of scanned books. In that respect the text is clean and user-friendly.\n\nAs a historical document, The Communist Manifesto is an invaluable artifact. As a philosophical text, it's brevity undermines its necessity. For any in-depth knowledge of the subject, you'll have to dive into Marx's Das Kapital.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

My opinion is that Marx satisfied both of these criteria.\n\nIf anything is to be learned from Communist Manifesto, one must adhere to the eastern philosophic principle of unlearning everything you know, before you read this book.  This work requires great rumination, and I mean this in a way that is as unbiased as possible.  Then, when you add in political and economic considerations, psychology, and even philosophy such as that of Hobbes, can this book be useful to us.

Based on human nature, can a society function economically and sociologically without incentive, and based on communal property?  I doubt it.  On the flipside, if there were no validity to this work, then why is there a minimum wage?\n\nMy overarching thought of Marx is that he was a superior diagnostician, but a horrible prescriber of remedies.

He makes it clear that the aim of communists is to overthrow the bourgeois class to be replaced with the proletariat class.\n\nThe third section describes the socialist and communist literature and describes each type of socialism.  He clearly dislikes socialists almost as much as he does capitalists.\n\nThe fourth section was a summary of the differences between communism and various other opposition parties, mostly socialists.  He dislikes most of them because they do not go far enough in overthrowing the existing systems of government.\n\nI was struck by his belief that swapping the two classes would result in a permanent fix to the problem.  History has born out that empowering the oppressed class just turns them eventually into oppressors.  Communists eventually become an elite class and there still becomes a less privileged class.  The incentive to excel becomes stifled and overall prosperity suffers.\n\nThis was worth reading and is a good reminder to all of us to do everything we can to prevent a class of people from feeling oppressed.

This introduction is far too big for the reader who just wants to read the Communist Manifesto, and far too specialised.\n\nSo after I skipped five thirds of the book, and got to the actual Manifesto, I was disappointed. Everything I knew about Communism wasn't there much. It talks about social classes and such, as you'd expect, but oddly, I didn't feel like it read like a manifesto. At any rate, I expected far more arguments. Instead, all you get is, roughly, a description of what Communism is, and by \"Communism\", I mean the type you had in 1840, which may or may not have all that much to do with the Communism we all know. Can't blame Marx for that, but instead of 218 pages of introduction on the details of what led to the manifesto, maybe more about 20th century Communism? Maybe other texts? Maybe excerpts from The Capital? I don't know, but 218 pages of introduction for such a short text should be justified, very justified, and in my opinion, it wasn't. I feel like I bought two books instead of one. No doubt, this introductory essay is precious for anyone who studies Karl Marx, and that's exactly why I doubt that a Penguin Classics is the right place to have it. Only specialists will enjoy it, and people who have never read the Communist Manifesto will not be so interested. 218 pages of intro, and 40 pages of main text, I had never seen that before.\n\nAnd after reading those 40 something pages of manifesto, I feel let down. I expected more. I thought Marx would develop much more in this text. Everything is upside down: the introduction is the size of a novel and develops everything to extremities I could not bring myself to be interested in, and the main text is the size of an introduction, develops little, and obviously addresses people of that time (quite logically, for a manifesto) and leaves one in an unsatisfying blur.\n\nNot worth your time. Had I known, I would still have read it because I like to know things first hand, but I now believe I would be better off with a book ABOUT Communism rather than this manifesto and its gargantuan introduction.\n\nVery disappointed. Check the intro if you're a political student or if you're very interested in Marxism or 19th century history, but if you're into Communism, I suggest getting something else. (I absolutely hate Communism, personally, and I wanted to know it better to precise my opinion and thoughts, in case you were curious; I will have to find something else.)", "Feedback": "negative"}

Included: Marx's life timeline, The Communist Manifesto, The 18th Brumaire, Theses on Feuerbach, and related prefaces. Also included, but not rated with 1 star is the Introduction.\n\nMarx was the ultimate moocher. He never had a job and was kicked out of countries for being an instigator. Engels was the ultimate enabler. He came from a wealthy, manufacturing family and supported Marx and his family. Oddly enough, Engels seemed to loathe the fortune he was born to, but rather than donating all to charity, he helped Marx in his efforts to demonize all private property.\n\nEngels admits that they originally wanted to name it \"The Socialist Manifesto\" but due to extraneous reasons and that \"mere revolutions were not enough\" they settled on \"Communist.\"\n\nA note to Communists/Socialists- Marx/Engels state that it is high time that you are open about your views and aims. Be honest.\n\nThere is an argument against current Capitalist society as having \"agglomerated population, centralized means of productions and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralization.\" Which I must argue, sounds like the definition of Fascism...not Capitalism.\n\nSo what is the cure for this disease? Centralization of property and power to the State. oh, that makes perfect sense. So now, all the mega-property owners can maintain status quo- playing footsie with politicians and even becoming those that govern. Sounds like musical chairs.\n\nThere are too many asinine ideas to detail, but some highlights (or lowlights) are; abolition of the family; abolition of home education; abolition of nations; abolition of eternal truth, religion, and morality; aboltion of private property; abolition of inheritance; progressive income tax (we have it!); confiscation of property; central bank (we have it!); centralized communication and transport; production owned by the State (GM); industrial armies (national service); abolition of town and country; free education (nothing is free).\n\nSign me up! I couldn't see how any tyrant could steer the reins of this centralized machine. If a tyrant wanted the blueprint on how to take over an entire nation, Socialism/Communism is the perfect design.\n\nIn regards to the rest of the content...incredibly tiresome.

The industrial process destabilized all hierarchies and subverted all sacred and secular inherited beliefs and practices. It turned everything everywhere into an object for sale.\nBut, it also liberated people from backwardness and tradition-bound dependence.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto splits the world in two hostile camps: the Bourgeoisie (the haves, the owners of the means of production) and the Proletariat (the have-nots).\n\nThe Bourgeoisie tore asunder the feudal society. It left no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest (cash payments). It created one freedom: free trade.\nBut the Bourgeoisie also created its nemesis, the Proletariat, a class of labourers who can live only so long as they find work and who can only find work if their labour increases capital (is profitable).\n\nIn order to survive, all Proletarians should unite all over the world in order to conquer political power and to create a free society.\nThis free society should be attained by the following measures: abolition of all private property, of the family nucleus, of all countries and nationalities, of all religions and moralities, of all rights of inheritance and of all child labour.\nAll production instruments (industry, property, banking) should be centralized in the hands of the State (monopolies). There should be a heavy progressive income tax and free education for everyone.\n\nOf course, this manifesto is partly extremely utopian (contrarian to biological `gene' interests) and far too optimistic about the `proletarian' management of State monopolies.\nBut its forceful message (ultimately, freedom for everyone) continues to send social, economic and political shockwaves all over the world.\n\nThis book contains also all the published prefaces of the manifesto, as well as excellent notes and suggestions for further reading.\nThis is probably the best, and certainly the most important, pamphlet ever written.\nA must read.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2UN4S3N7VYLEV", "ProductID": "B000FC27TA", "Review": "An important work of historical significance Beloved by many, reviled by many more, from a literary standpoint it is amazing that a book 150+ years old probably evokes stronger emotions now than when it was first published.  Of course, reading the Manifesto now, it is nearly impossible to separate this small ideological work from the historical events before, during, and after the Cold War that indelibly etched people's impressions of \"Communism\" into their minds.  Adherents of Communism protest that the regimes in the USSR and China under Stalin and Mao were not truly \"communist\" (and they are likely correct in their protestation), but the reality is that for most people born and raised on this side of the Iron Curtain, the communist ideology of Marx and Engels became inseparable from the communism-in-practice of self-identified communists like Mao, Kim, Castro, and Stalin.  All became the \"face\" of Commumism for many, whether rightfully or not.\n\nToday, the Manifesto is still a shocking document.  Full of pessimism about the old order and hope for a new one, the reader cannot help but be absorbed by the text from the first mention of the \"spectre of Communism\" haunting Europe to the final cry for the working man to cast off his chains and unite.  There is passion, youthfulness, and idealism behind the words; an urgency captured by an appeal more to the heart than to the mind.  After all, this is an intendedly propagandist piece for mobilizing the working class: Marx and Engels probably figured, what proletarian has time to read and digest the vast tome of Das Kapital?\n\nPut into its historical context, however, perhaps it should not be so shocking that a work like the Manifesto emerged given the circumstances.  A series of revolutions and restorations marked the violent death throes of feudalism, which did not go quietly into the night.  Seeing the end of a political, economic, and social order that had reigned supreme over Europe for centuries, it should not be surprising that Marx did not place much faith in the permanence of the status quo, nor did he underestimate the power of insurrection.  It should not be all that surprising that class struggle and the oppression of the working class should capture Marx's attention either, for we only need to read the works of history or the fiction of his contemporaries to know that the gap between the \"haves\" and have-nots\" in the beginning of the industrial age was quite extreme.  This is clear, whether one is reading the Manifesto or Oliver Twist.  Social issues of poverty, illiteracy, poor health care, etc. makes the plight of the exploited understandably dire and immediate.  It is no wonder that Marx expected capitalism as he knew it to sow the seeds of its own ruin.\n\nBut what happened was not the collapse of capitalism, but its evolution.  The fact that modern readers are as horrified by the conditions described by Dickens as Marx was speaks to the fact that capitalism and social progress are not mutually exclusive phenomena.  The reality is that just as \"pure\" Communism has never been practiced, neither has \"pure\" Capitalism.  Remembering that Adam Smith was as much moral philosopher as (political) economist, this is not so surprising.  Indeed, it is interesting that of the ten policies clearly articulated by Marx in the Manifesto, a number of them (progressive taxation, strong central banks, free education, etc.) are in practice in capitalist societies around the world today.  Some have argued that this simply represents the adoption of Marxist ideas into capitalism, but let's remember that Adam Smith advocated a progressive tax long before Karl Marx did.  What's more important is the fact that disparate theories can apparently support strikingly similar policies.  For me, I think it's important to recognize that all systems of social organization have their warts, and that all systems can learn something from the others: no single ideology has a monopoly on good ideas.\n\nMy intent is not to get into a discussion of the relative merits of capitalism versus communism, because others have already done so much more elegantly and persuasively than I.  My final point to make is that I believe the Communist Manifesto is a book that should be read, regardless of where you stand on the political and economic spectrum.  It is a book of importance given its immense influence on subsequent historical events.  It is also a valuable reminder that the economic, political, and social spheres are very much interrelated in their evolution.  A diversity of opinions can only serve to improve the status quo, and it is my hope that readers can approach the Manifesto with an objective mind for critical analysis of its merits and its flaws.", "Feedback": "positive"}

It evolved from a prior eternity of monarchs dominating the poor and a response to the scourge of serfdom. Ultimately, Lenin used \"The Communist Manifesto\" as a means of promoting the Russian Revolution which ultimately became the cultural horror which the rest of us came to know as The Soviet Union. In other words, it provided the basis for a ploy on the part of the Bolsheviks (Communist Party).\n\nDuring the years of Communism, the Soviet workers used to convey a covertly-spoken credo: \"We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us\". That pretty much sums up how Marx's and Engels' plan played out in actual practice.\n\nStrangely, few people ever make the observation that the ideas of Marx and Engels were not at all original. Thomas More (1478-1535) conveyed almost the same concept when he scribed his famous work:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Thomas-More-s-Utopia/dp/1604500301/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Thomas More's Utopia</a>. In fact, people who have obviously never read \"Utopia\" would clearly not cite it as \"the ideal society\" if they were even slightly apprised of the numerous horrors of that fictional society. And so goes \"The Communist Manifesto\" in actual practice.\n\nStill, this is an incredible, eye-opening read and we SHOULD read it if for no other reason than to see how mans' best-laid plans can easily go awry.

It is extremely interesting that historical information presented to support the need for communism is misrepresented, either accidentally (by mistake) or on purpose (a lie).

The reality is that literal starvation and death from disease were often widespread before the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThat event, the application of machinery to the manufacturing process, significantly upgraded the lives and incomes of those who participated. One example is clothing. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most clothing was made of wool. It could not be washed, or it would shrink. People of the lower class -- the overwhelming majority class -- wore unsanitary, uncomfortable clothing year-round. After steam engines were applied to the weaving process, inexpensive cotton cloth enabled the abundant manufacture of durable, washable clothing to which everyone had ready access. The Industrial Revolution, a product of capitalism, upgraded human existence to a degree never before seen in the world.\n\nAgain, this is definitely an important book to read -- for the right reasons.

After he was done with it, I decided to read it since this was one of the founding documents for Communism.\n\nI found it difficult to decide how to rate this book. The presentation of Manifesto by Penguin in this book is excellent. The central ideas of the Manifesto itself are disturbing.\n\nShould you read the Communist Manifesto? Yes. Is this a good presentation? Yes. Was Communism envisioned by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels a good idea? No.  So I have compromised between the excellent presentation and the ideas espoused by the Manifesto in selecting an average rating.\n\nSome reviewers feel that the Manifesto's critique of capitalism is right on; I have grave doubts. Marx and Engels were critiquing capitalism from an ivory tower. Their remedies for capitalism show that they had no real experience or contact with the workers in the trenches.\n\nSome reviewers have mentioned the changing of labor laws due to the Manifesto, such as child labor laws (a generally agreed good thing). I believe those laws would have changed if the Manifesto had never been written. I believe those reviewers are seeing cause and effect relationships where there is none. I believe labor leaders in non-Communist states, pushing for change in labor laws, did not need belief in Communism behind them to push for change. Even without Communism, they would have done what they did anyways because the labor leaders came up from the laboring trenches. They knew first hand the abuses going on. The writers of the Manifesto did not; their ideas were theoretical. I know my ideas, in this area, are conjectures of what would have happened without the Manifesto, without Communism; there is no way they can be proven, history cannot be rewritten.\n\nThe remedy proposed by Marx and Engels is frightening. It foreshadows exactly how Communism gave birth to totalitarian states, to Communist dictatorships. Their remedy for capitalism requires a select group of leaders (Communist elitists) to force Communism onto the populace for the good of the people.  We should all be suspicious of anyone who professes an idea that is for the good of the people because it invariably is not good for the people. To paraphase Lord Acton, \"power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely,\" and the states envisioned by the writers of the Manifesto set up perfect conditions of absolute power (for the good of the people) which in practice led to absolutely corrupt power. History has shown there has been extreme abuse by Communist leaders, who became power meglomanics, of the masses of workers in their states.\n\nIndeed, history has repeatedly shown that the concentration of power in the hands of a select few led to abuse of power.  The smaller the select, the greater the abuse. This has been true regardless of the political theories espoused by the leaders. Let this be a cautionary tale to all of us.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

{"ReviewerID": "AGEIT17HENDIS", "ProductID": "B000FC27TA", "Review": "THE FOUNDATION OF MODERN COMMUNISM This year is the 160th Anniversary of the publication of the Communist League's Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx in 1848, a document that has played a central role in world history since then, if not always happily. Below is a review of this document that I wrote in 2006 and proudly stand by today.\n\nIf you are a revolutionary, a radical or merely a liberal activist you must come to terms with the theory outlined in the Communist Manifesto. Today's political activists are obviously not the first to face this challenge. Radicals, revolutionaries and liberals have had to come to terms with the Manifesto at least since 1848, when it was first published.  That same necessity; perhaps surprisingly to some given the changes in the political landscape since then, is true today. Why surprisingly? On the face of it, given the political times, it would appear somewhat absurd to make such a claim about the necessity of coming to terms with the overriding need for the revolutionary overturn of the capitalist order outlined in the Manifesto. It, however, is.\n\nWith the collapses of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-influenced Eastern European states about fifteen years ago, which were supposedly based on Marxist concepts, one would think that Marxism was a dead letter. But hear me out. Even the less far-sighted apologists for the international capitalist order are now worrying about the increasing gap between rich and poor, not only between the so-called first and third worlds but also within the imperial metropolitan centers themselves. Nowhere is that more evident that in the United States where that gap has dramatically increased over the last thirty years. Thus, despite the carping of the `death of communism' theorists after the decisive capitulation of international Stalinism in the early 1990's, an objective criterion exists today to put the question posed by the ongoing class struggle and of the validity of a materialist concept of history back on the front burner.\n\nWhether one agrees with the Marxian premises about the need for revolution and for a dialectical materialist conception of the workings of society or not one still must, if for no other reason that to be smart about the doings of the world, confront the problem of how to break the stalemate over where human history is heading. 'Globalization' has clearly demonstrated only that the 'race to the bottom' inherent in the inner workings of capitalism is continuing at full throttle. Moreover, the contradictions and boom/bust cycles of capitalism have not been resolved. And those results have not been pretty for the peoples of the world.\n\nExperience over the last 160 years has shown that those who are not armed with a materialist concept of history, that is, the ability to see society in all its workings and contradictions, cannot understand the world. All other conceptual frameworks lead to subjectivist idealism and utopian concepts of social change, at best. One may ultimately answer the questions posed by the Manifesto in the negative but the alternatives leave one politically defenseless in the current one-sided international class war.\n\nSo what is the shouting over Marxism, pro and con, all about? In the middle of the 19th century, especially in Europe, it was not at all clear where the vast expansion and acceleration of industrial society was heading. All one could observe was that traditional society was being rapidly disrupted and people were being uprooted, mainly from the land, far faster than at any time in previous history. For the most part, political people at that time reacted to the rise of capitalism with small plans to create utopian societies off on the side of society or with plans to smash the industrial machinery in order to maintain an artisan culture (the various forms of Ludditism). Into this chaos a young Karl Marx stepped in, and along with his associate and co-thinker Friedrich Engel, gave a, let us face it, grandiose plan for changing all of society based on the revolutionary overthrow of existing society.\n\nMarx thus did not based himself on creation of some isolated utopian community but rather took the then current level of international capitalist society as a starting point and expanded his thesis from that base. Now that was then, and today still is, a radical notion. Marx, however, did not just come to those conclusions out of the blue. As an intellectual (and frustrated academian) he took the best of German philosophy (basically from Hegel, then the rage of German philosophical academia), French political thought and revolutionary tradition especially the Great French Revolution of the late 1700'and English political economy.\n\nIn short, Marx took the various strands of Enlightenment thought and action and grafted those developments onto a theory, not fully formed at the time, of how the proletariat was to arise and take over the reins of society for the benefit of all of society and end class struggle as the motor force of history. Unfortunately, given the rocky road of socialist thought and action over the last 160 years, we are, impatiently, still waiting for that new day.\n\nIn recently re-reading the Manifesto this writer was struck by how much of the material in it related, taking into account the technological changes and advances in international capitalist development since 1848, to today's political crisis of humankind. Some of the predictions and some of the theory are off, no question, particularly on the questions of the relative staying power of capitalism, the relative impoverishment of the masses, the power of the nation-state and nationalism to cut across international working class solidarity and the telescoping of the time frame of capitalist development but the thrust of the material presented clearly speaks to us today. Maybe that is why today the more far-sighted bourgeois commentators are nervous at the reappearance of Marxism in Western society as a small but serious current in the international labor movement. Militant leftists can now argue- Stalinism (the horrendous distortion of Marxism) never again, to the bourgeois commentators' slogan of - socialist revolution, never again.\n\nAs a historical document one should read the Manifesto with the need for updating in mind. The reader should nevertheless note the currency of the seemingly archaic third section of the document where Marx polemicized against the leftist political opponents of his time. While the names of the organizations of that time have faded away into the historical mist the political tendencies he argued against seem to very much analogous to various tendencies today. In fact, in my youth I probably argued in favor of every one of those tendencies that Marx opposed before I was finally won over to the Marxian worldview. I suggest that not only does humankind set itself the social tasks that it can reasonably perform but also that when those tasks are not performed there is a tendency to revert to earlier, seemingly defeated ideas, of social change. Thus the resurgent old pre-Marxian conceptions of societal change have to be fought out again by this generation of militant leftists. That said, militant leftists should read and reread this document. It is literarily the foundation document of the modern communist movement. One can still learn much from it.

Along with Das Kapital, this was one of the first major works in human history to link economics with sociology and political institutions, this text has done for economic liberty and equality what the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence has done for political liberty and equality.  Written by Marx as part propaganda to invoke change, and part retribution to his enemies; intellectual and otherwise, this book has inspired political movements ever since.\n\nIn short, the book argues for equality, security, and freedom in the economic realm.  Specifically, Marx lays out a series of planks, or reforms, that he believes societies should undertake to solve the problems of laissez-faire capitalism.  These include the abolition of child labor, public funding of a universal social security program, a minimum wage, progressive taxation, free public education for all children irregardless of heritage, employee-financed disability benefits, universal health care, etc...\n\nIf one looks thru at the ensuing 150 years since its initial publication; those nations that have seen the highest raises in standards of living are those that have implemented the majority of these reforms.  These nations include Singapore, Canada, post-WWII Japan, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, and the USA.  If one looks within nations, such as the USA for example, those states with the higher standards of living generally have adopted more of these reforms at an ealier date than those states with a lower standard of living.  I measure standard of living by criteria such as life expectancy, infant mortality rate, crime rates, rates of incarceration, etc...\n\nCritical throughout all these nations is the enfranchisement of a greater percentage of the population in both economic and political rights.  Democracy and equality are the keys here, whether it be in local elections, stockholder meetings, or decision making inside corporations.  Democracy and equality are what Marx argued for in this work, though he does so in a language we in the 21st century find hard to decipher.\n\nLikewise, those nations that have witnessed the worst standards of living are those that have mostly ignored the ideas in this book.  Maoist China and the USSR under Stalin are the two ideal examples.  Contrary to the popular view of conservatives and mainstream thought, neither of these countries examplified communism.  Both examplified one thing and one thing only; dictatorships of a few over the many.  In both countries, it is the few who control the resources, make the decisions, and make the profits.  The rest of the population sacrifice and work.  Both Maoist China and the USSR are essentially aristocracies.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this book.  Read it slowly and read it carefully; then look at the history of the world since then.  You will quickly realize that the reforms it advocates are those that have improved living standards everywhere.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "ProductID": "B000FC27TA", "Review": "An excellent edition of a political classic My five star rating is based on the quality of this handsome edition of one of the classics of political philosophy.  Classics of this magnitude, whether Adam Smith's THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, Tocqueville's DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA, or THE FEDERALIST PAPERS have achieved a status that makes the assigning of a rating rather silly.  Regardless of one's feelings about Marxism or Communism, a work of such gigantic influence is of such a status that rating it is almost silly.  It is one of the constitutive artifacts of our culture.\n\nThe particular edition I am reviewing is the recent reissue on Verso with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm.  There are a host of editions of THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO, and virtually any of them will do the trick, but I very much enjoyed this edition, partly for the handsome jacket and binding, and partly for the superb intro by Hobsbawm.  It is not a new translation, and indeed it isn't clear that there will ever be much of a demand for a new translation.  The MANIFESTO was first published in 1848 and this translation in 1888.  Moore's translation is the standard one for a simple reason:  Engels examined it closely and helped Moore in editing the final draft of the translation.\n\nAlthough I had read a fair amount in the writings of Marx over the years, this was my first time to read the work from cover to cover.  I found it surprising on several levels.  First, it was a much easier to read work than I had anticipated.  This is upon reflection hardly surprising.  The work was intended as a pamphlet for the masses, and it was essential that it be as understandable as possible.  Also, the concepts and ideas articulated in these pages have become a part of the intellectual landscape of Western civilization.  A host of ideas are commonplace, even among those who do not consider themselves sympathetic towards Marxism.  It has become a commonplace of the past decade that Communism and Democracy clashed, and Communism lost.  But the fact is that Marxist thought has exerted a massive influence on the way we view the world, and many things introduced by Marx are now central constituents of our world.  Just look at the way we write history now.  Before Marx a detailed consideration of the economic factors in an era was unheard of; now it is considered essential.\n\nAs a credo, I find myself conflicted over its contents, just as I always find myself conflicted in reading Marx.  Marx's analyses of the dynamics governing capitalist society have always struck me as dead on.  No one writes more presciently or timelessly about the structures of exploitation that are inherent in capitalism.  Nonetheless, I find his positive proposals as to how to transcend capitalism to be untenable, and the post-capitalist world he describes to be undesirable.  The best way to express this is that I find Marx the critic to be convincing and impressive, but Marx the visionary to be irrelevant.  I want us to pay attention to Marx's critiques, but not to his proposals for change.\n\nI was delighted in reading the book to find the word \"highfalutin\" in the text.  The world seems somehow to be a more charming place for the unexpected presence of such a light-hearted word in the midst of a serious text.\n\nThough listed as the work of Marx and Engels, Marx was the primary creator of the work.  He also did the bulk of the writing.  It isn't sufficiently commented on what a beautiful writer Marx could be when he tried.  Too often he adopts the try academic style begun with Christian Wolff and continued by Kant, Fichte, and Hegel.  But a host of exquisite phrases such as \"All that is solid melts into air\" shows that Marx could turn a phrase when conviction didn't prevent him.\n\nEveryone interested in political thought or modern history needs to read this book.  Its influence--its ongoing influence--is incalculable.  Its critique of the exploitative nature of capitalism remains astonishingly relevant.  And its predictions about the future course of history, even if no longer inspiring or convincing, are crucial to grasp if one is to understand many of the political impulses of the past one hundred and fifty years.", "Feedback": "positive"}

It is priced to be used as a tool by workers, youth, rebels. Read what Marx and Engels have to say in sweepingly powerful language about what capitalism has done, good and bad, and how there IS a way out for working people, farmers, oppressed peoples.\n\n  Because so many try to tie the Manifesto to rotten corpse of Stalinism in the Soviet Union, the inroduction to this edition is absolutely essential. It is an introduction Leon Trotsky, the great revolutionary opponent of Stalin, wrote especially for American readers in the 1930s.

Particulary if you are a baby boomer, you were raised to hate communism. While Marx's thoughts are idealistic at best, they definitely serve as food for thought.\nMarx's economic beliefs suggest that the working class will rise up and overthrow the rich/ruling class in order to create a classless society. Their are several flaws that have been historically pointed out in relation to Marx's theory.  The most common flaw would suggest that Marx never foresaw the advent of a middle class society which is content unlike the working class.  This makes any revolution unlikely. One question to ask is \"Are people greedy?\" If you believe people are greedy, then the theories of Marx can not work. Greedy people could not allow themselves to be equal in the amount of toys they have with the general population. Greed would destroy communism just as it did in the Soviet Union.  The greed of some is one of the ultimate reasons the Soviet Union collapsed.  However, Cuba is still survivng and Castro as seen as a saint in Cuba.\nWhile Marx's ideas are thought provoking, they are generally useless in the modern world.

That is simply untrue.  The Industrial Revolution, an offshoot of the Enlightenment in Scotland, gave rise to the mass production and transporation of goods in the United Kingdom (by people seeking profits) which significantly upgraded the quality of life there.  One example is cotton; industrialization so increased the utilization of cotton that cloth became affordable to everyone -- people very quickly, for the first time in history, had access to inexpensive, clean and serviceable clothing.\n\nAnd there is the reality that people simply are not equal in ability, initiative, intelligence, energy and other productive attributes.  The elimination of profits in enterprises is a certain way to smother productivity and create equality.... equality of destitution.  Most curious is why the authors attacked capitalism.  What was their motive?  Insecurity, jealousy?  Capitalism has upgraded human existence on a wide scale as no other system ever has or can.  Why did this pair attack that?", "Feedback": "negative"}

At the time it seemed tedious and impenetrable. Recently I re-read it and was amazed at how clear it seemed and what an effective piece of propaganda it was and how clear was the writing.\nReading through the program one realises the distance that has been travelled since it was written. Some of the major planks are the Abolition of Child Labour, the creation of a progressive income tax and Free Education.\nPerhaps one of its major weaknesses is that Marx was a person who tended to carry a grudge. Thus a third of it is devoted to attacks on some of his contemporary enemies and rivals. These disputes have so long passed into history they are incomprehensible.\nThe modern notion of Communism of course stems not from Marx but from Stalin and Lenin. Marx wrote at a time when the only democratic country in Europe was France. England, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire all had limited franchises and Russia was of course an autocracy.  One of the major reforms he battled for was the introduction of democracy. It was his belief that the implementation of his program would flow from that.\nFollowing Marx's death his movement evolved into a parliamentary movement the Social Democratic Party.  Communism as a modern political phenomena dates from 1917 when splinter Social Democrats followed Russia's lead and developed small conspiratorial parties who were committed to the seizure of power by force. Stalinism is an offshoot of this system and is a form of state terror aimed at ensuring the survival of unpopular anti democratic regimes.\nReading through the Manifesto one can see the basis of a system which was not only an effective for mobilising political movements, but came to influence intellectual debate for the next century. There is also perhaps a sense of a naive optimism which could not contemplate the sorts of disasters which were to occur over the next hundred years.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I have read numerous books over the years on near-death experiences. In all the cases the experience usually changed the person in many mysterious and joyful ways.  I found this 149 page hardcover book (My descent into death: A second chance at life by Howard Storm with the forward by Anne Rice) in our local library at the free book section.\n\n  I was  impressed reading this book because of the authors sincere and heartwarming story on his near-death experiences which happened while visiting Paris, France.  His serious stomach pain caused him to slip out of his early body and unlike most near-death experiences, this one began with demons giving him the most horrid experience he ever felt.\n\nWhat made this an interesting story was the author was saved from these demons with his recognition and love from God and his angels.  Strangely for me, before I became a Reiki master I would have dismissed this book and the authors experiences as delusional and mystical; however, I have become more open minded to some of the spiritual experiences of people.\nThe material in this book covers the following short chapters: Paris, the descent, alone, the light, life review, the past and the future, what happens when we die, why we are the way we are, reality, the argument, waking up, Lisa and Clarence, sent back, next to heaven, limbo, telling the story, a second chance at life, angels, pilgrim and afterword.\n\nIf you are seeking sincere experiences involving near-death and visions of God and angels you may want to check out this interesting book, which you can get for a bargain price on amazon.\n\nRating: 4 Stars.

They --- and Johansen fans in general --- will be pleased to find that her latest book resolves a number of the issues left open in BLIND ALLEY while creating a couple of new ones for future novels to deal with.\n\nCOUNTDOWN occurs some four years after the events of BLIND ALLEY. Jane MacGuire, now a 21-year-old college student, is a success by any definition as she juggles work, education, friends, and family with equal aplomb. She is still haunted, however, by the memory of the intriguing, enigmatic, and dangerous Mark Trevor. When an attempted kidnapping of MacGuire ends unsuccessfully, but nonetheless tragically, Trevor makes a sudden and dramatic return into MacGuire's life. Trevor, for the sake of MacGuire's safety, spirits her away to an ancient, brooding castle in Scotland, where the two of them must confront their unresolved and unrefined feelings for each other while dealing with the dangers of the outside world.\n\nMacGuire also finds that renewed contact with Trevor results in a resumption of the enigmatic haunting dreams that previously had troubled her. These dreams involve a woman named Cira, a proud slave of the Roman Empire who seems to lie at the heart of a mystery that spans two millenniums and that involves a treasure of immeasurable historical and monetary wealth.\n\nAs in BLIND ALLEY, Trevor is aligned against those who feel that MacGuire holds the key to the mystery of the treasure's whereabouts. But the stakes are much higher in COUNTDOWN. One of the treasure seekers has entered into a mutual aid agreement with terrorists who threaten the United States. MacGuire and Trevor ultimately find themselves in a race against time and distance as they leave safety and security to bring the battle home --- and to hopefully solve the mystery of Cira's treasure.\n\nFans of BLIND ALLEY will be thrilled with COUNTDOWN. The novel fully comes to terms with the relationship between Trevor and MacGuire, while leaving the possibility of more --- or less --- between them open for the future. There also is an extremely interesting development concerning MacGuire's heritage coming totally out of left field that provides a possible key to the dreams that have haunted her for so long.\n\nJohansen therefore simultaneously satisfies readers who were seeking resolution of issues left open at the end of BLIND ALLEY while leaving them wanting more after COUNTDOWN. This is an enviable position for an author, and one that Johansen is sure to utilize to its fullest in future books.\n\n  --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub", "Feedback": "positive"}

Eve Duncan's ward, Jane MacGuire, is now at Harvard and is 21 so 4 years have passed since the last book.  She is close to Mike who is a ward of Eve's mom.  Jane is always helping people out of scrapes and feels particularly responsible for Mike.  His roommate calls her that Mike is drunk and morose at a bar.  Jane goes to get him and take him home but on the way to the car they are attacked and Mike is shot and killed.\n\nIt turns out the kidnappers were really after Jane and Mike was just in the way.  Mark Trevor, from \"Blind Alley\", has been keeping an eye on Jane due to the search for Cira's gold.  He decides to \"rescue\" her and persuades her to come with him to Scotland where he has a translator working to discover where Cira's gold is.\n\nLots of secondary characters are introduced including the laird of the castle, MacDuff, his ward, Jock who is a very disturbed young man, and Mario Donato, the translator.  Back from the last book also is Barlett who is a very loyal and funny character.\n\nWhile we do know the villain(s) in this book early on, the possible tragedies setup and the dicey situations keep the suspense going.  Also, the bit of mysticism with Jane's strange and realistic dreams of Cira also keep the story very interesting.  We get to know Jane and Trevor quite a bit better although I would still like to know them more.\n\nEve and Joe have only minor parts while some of the secondary characters are developed pretty well and play major roles.  If you liked \"Blind Alley\", you will probably like this book.  If you didn't like it or don't like any \"mysticism\", this will not be a good plot for you.\n\nI loved it and recommend it!!", "Feedback": "positive"}

Carnton set on the edge of the bloody battlefied and was quickly filled both inside and out with the dead and dying and many with gruesome, life-altering injuries.  There is much more human interest and resulting relationships explored in this novel than there is about the actual waging of the battle, although the military parts are actually beautifully written and terribly engaging.\n\nCarrie, her husband, John, and their slaves were all drawn into the unending demands of the retreating armies and overwhelmed with the men left in their care.  Carrie's two young children romped about among amputees, the sightless, and the mortally wounded with gaping parts of themselves altered or missing.  The events following the battle remake Carrie into the person she believe God has always expected her to become.  She, helped by her life-long servant, Mariah, and to a lesser extent her husband and Zachariah, the soldier she inexplicably falls in love with, finds an inner strength and goes on through the rest of her life to save and protect both the living and the dead who fall in Franklin and find themselves in her charge.  She reburied almost 1,500 dead soldiers on the grounds of Carnton to protect them from being plowed over in their original graves on the battlefield.  Until her death in 1905, she walked the cemetery daily and oversaw the graves with loving attention.  Her cemetery is now maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.  In the 1980's, the foundation began efforts to restore Carnton.  There are wonderful photos of Carrie, Mariah, John, the cemetery and Carnton in the author's notes at the end...worth reading.\n\nThe book is beautifully written and Robert Hicks is very talented.  One of my few faults is that, on occasion, there is entirely too much narrative.  Other parts are mesmerizing and move along perfectly and quickly.

After reading it, the only thing it has in common with \"The Killer Angels\" is that they both take place during the Civil War.\n\nIt starts out with great promise and in fact has a decent ending chapter, but everything else between was a let down. At times I felt like the book was transforming into a historical romance novel or at its worst a bad Lifetime movie. Now, there's nothing wrong with historical romance novels, but that's not the kind of book I wanted to read.\n\nIf the purpose of the book was to make you care about Carrie McGavock, for me at least, it fails. I'm sure the real Mrs. McGavock was a very interesting person, but I doubt she was anything like the person portrayed in this book. Her \"romance\" is so unbelievable and based on such pure fiction that it makes me wonder how angry the real Carrie McGavock would be if she could read it...not to mention how the real Mr. McGavock would feel about it. Meanwhile the man at the center of her attraction is unlikeable and comes across as ignorant. Why Mrs. McGavock would feel attracted to him all the while her husband just stands by and accepts it is never understood. Her husband is a kind gentleman who has given her everything and would do anything for her. She feels nothing for him for most of the book (for no reason given in the book) yet falls for this guy who is rude, stupid and has breath that smells like rotting hay...makes no sense and is borderline defamation of character.\n\nThe real story of Carrie McGavock takes place in the house turned hospital and in the last twenty pages of the book. Everything else just feels like words to make the book longer and to make Carrie McGavock seem more 21st century rather than what she probably actually was.\n\nAnd if you do a little research after reading the book you'll find that not even the ending is all that accurate.

Carrie McGavock finds the strength to care for the wounded men, and later to transplant all the dead men into her own cemetery, where she mourns for them during the tremulous reconstruction years.

It isn't so much about the war and why it was fought, but about the people who were forced to fight it, and lost.

Unfortunately, not all novelists are fit to tackle such a subject.\n\nRobert Hicks, in his debut work of fiction, sets out to prove otherwise.  With his own research around Franklin, TN, he has gathered facts and anecdotes to bolster his story of the infamous battle fought in this region.  With his own history as a Southerner, he has unique insight into the mindset of those involved in the battle.  But is he able to turn these strengths into a gripping tale which orbits the grim servitude of one Carrie McGavock, a woman who has lost three of her own children and now finds herself immersed in the lives of soldiers wounded and dying?\n\nQuite simply...Yes!  \"The Widow of the South\" beautifully threads together the lives of the poor and rich, the slaves and free, the living and dying.

I picked up this book on a whim because I was in the bargain for a historical novel with gothic undertones and with a palpable historical backdrop.  However, The Widow of the South failed to grab me and take me to the world of its characters and time setting alike.  The Widow of the South is a fictional account on the life of Carrie McGavock, a grieving Confederate wife who has lost interest in life in general after the Civil War battle begins and her home is commandeered for a field hospital and cemetery.  She lives a miserable life after the death of three of her children, and pays little attention to her remaining living children and of her plantation, which is now under the care of a slave called Mariah.  Carrie lives quite a lonely, empty existence, wearing black gowns all the time, grieving the loss of her children.  But her life isn't the same after she meets Zachariah Cashwell, a solider who loses one of his legs during the battle.  Zachariah and Carrie begin a strange, disturbing relationship that has some very disarming moments.  There are various twists throughout the novel.\n\nThe novel started out well at first.  The Civil War has always fascinated me and the account of Carrie McGavock is quite interesting in spite of the fact that I hadn't heard about the aforementioned person until now.  The scenes centered on the battles and the things people go through due to the war are rather riveting at times and I enjoyed that part of the novel very much.  However, the story of Carrie and Zachariah put me off this story.  This \"love story,\" though dark and morbid at times, wasn't interesting or literary to me in the slightest.  I was left wishing that the author had continued to concentrate more on the Civil War than on interactions between these two characters.  And so, the overall novel failed to grab me at that point.  Also, I wanted to know more about Carrie, about her grief and her children and about her husband, stories that weren't developed enough for my taste.  Overall, The Widow of the South is a little too disjointed for me.  There are some wonderful scenes and some symbolism thrown in for good measure, but at the end I wasn't compelled with this book and I couldn't wait to finish it.

She is unwilling to turn her home into a respite for any army, but the General is firm in his demand.\n\nMore than 9,000 men die on the battlefield at Franklin in the following days. The Confederacy is near its demise; its loss at Franklin is a step closer to eventual surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. Carrie's close friend and former slave, Mariah, stands beside her for support when hundreds of broken bodies are brought to Carnton.\n\nIn historical memory, perhaps Franklin is not a formidable one. But Robert Hicks writes its story and brings to life the men who fought, healed or died there. The romantic interest in THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH is between two unlikely personalities --- Carrie McGavock and a Confederate Sergeant named Zachariah Cashwell. He's severely wounded and transported to Carnton; Carrie finds him a compelling patient and yearns to know him better. She's instrumental in saving his life but cannot keep him under Carnton's protective wing when soldiers in gray are herded like cattle to Union prison camps.\n\nFranklin's rural residents, some in abject poverty and others in comfortable homesteads, provide a colorful panorama of lives affected by civil war. Side plots involve townspeople whose lives will change forever. The grieving widow takes strength from the men who have resided within her house, however short their time. Carnton's halls are filled with activity, then abruptly emptied. But she cannot forget those who died at Carnton. She begins a correspondence with families of the dead to provide relatives with knowledge about boys they've lost, eventually leading to their reburial on her land. She wears black in memory of them all.\n\nHicks's chapters are laid out much the same as those written by Jeff Shaara in his compelling Civil War books. Sections are titled by characters whose points of view are explored within, or by dates that story actual wartime timelines. Some are written in first person, others in third person, but the book flows forward in an easy read that catches readers' attention throughout.\n\nWill Baylor, Franklin's elitist businessman, is a stubborn anti-war zealot who sacrifices his only son rather than accept the boy's passion for the cause. In addition, the son has dared to fall in love with a girl whose family lives in poverty. Baylor's whims affect the fates of the entire populace, ultimately changing the stance that Carrie takes against him.\n\nTHE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH is the product of Hicks's research about Franklin, in particular the restoration of the Carnton plantation as a historical site, home to the cemetery Carrie McGavock built to honor the thousands of dead who lost their lives at Franklin, Tennessee. Relationships between Carrie, husband John, Mariah and her son Eli, and Zachariah Cashwell are fictional, but the reality of the battle and the losses sustained by the Confederacy are fact. Promotional material compares THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH to the likes of GONE WITH THE WIND and DR. ZHIVAGO. I would not classify Hicks's book with such lofty classics, but I do recommend it as a historical novel with enthralling personalities.\n\n  --- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad", "Feedback": "positive"}

Those are the novels where a reviewer can only attempt to whet the reader's appetite and then simply allow them to discover the richness that exists within. The Widow of the South by Robert Hicks is just such a book.\n\nHicks has written a fictional account of the true story about the Civil War and Carrie Cradock. In Franklin, Tennessee, Carrie Cradock is mourning the loss of three of her children and is concerned about her husband's safety. The war is raging and Carrie and her slave, Mariah are left to run the plantation.\n\nCanton Plantation, Carrie's home, is turned into a field hospital. During a brutal battle 9,000 Americans died and many others were wounded. The dead were buried on a neighboring plantation. Several years later, when the dead soldiers were in danger of being plowed under by the plantation's owner, Carrie reburied many in her own personal cemetery where she carefully tended the graves.\n\nA wounded soldier, Zachariah Caldwell, is not of Carrie's class, yet he wakes in her feelings she didn't know she had. Their love for each other is not to be. And when they part, it is forever. But forever is not always the way life turns out. As an old woman, tending to her graves, the wounded soldier returns to ask a question.\n\nHicks has written a compelling, poignant and touching story of a woman whose circumstances shapes the person she will become. The characters are richly drawn and the disaster of war so real, it is frightening. In The Widow of the South, Hicks recreated a tragedy of American History that should not be forgotten.\n\nArmchair Interviews says: The Widow of the South is a must read that will leave you breathless.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A265NE6H6LYX87", "ProductID": "B000FCKEWC", "Review": "A Meandering Look at the Battle of Franklin This novel's premise intrigued me because I live close to Franklin, Tennessee, and have learned a good deal about the Battle of Franklin in recent years.  McGavock is a well-known name around Nashville, which added to my interest.  I eagerly picked this book up and dived in, prepared to meet the main characters and learn more about the battle and its aftermath, and previous reviews made the book that much more appealing.  However, as I read, I found myself disappointed in the actual retelling of the battle itself; I was hoping for more action and deeper characterizations.  The plot meanders between points of view and Carrie McGavock's motivations are particularly difficult to understand.  On a personal level, I could delve into her darkness of depression over the loss of her children, but since it was a common occurrence in the mid 1800s, I found it a bit over-the-top.  Her feelings for Zachariah are not in character and are never believable.  Mariah is a strong character who never achieves her own voice and a few of the side stories seem forced as well.  The novel finally achieves its goals in the last 100 pages as the focus for Carrie becomes clear and her determination shows.  Hicks has a wonderful way with words but he needs to show the why of his characters rather than letting them stew in their own juices for much of the story.  Overall this is a good book, but not as compelling as I'd hoped.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO", "ProductID": "B000FCKEWC", "Review": "Promising Start After a very promising start in which the Battle of Franklin was described and the characters introduced, this first novel went downhill.\n\nThis is the story of how a Confederate graveyard came to be on the plantation grounds of Crofton in the Town of Franklin after the brutal battle there.  According to the historical note at the end of the book (which is very interesting) the novel is based upon the true story of \"Miss Carrie\", the dame of the plantation whose home is taken as a hospital for the battle and her subsequent efforts to protect the buried of bodies of the Confederate dead buried on the battlefield immediately after the bloodbath.\n\nThe initial scenes of the house as a hospital, Carrie's work and the interest taken in her by one of the wounded Arkansans is eerily similar to the plot of Bahr's \"The Black Flower\".  At this point the book is still good and the characters, who tell their stories in brief chapters are still interesting.\n\nWithin days of the battle and the amputation of the Arkansan's leg, the plot falls off.  There is what, I guess, could be called a love story that developes between Carrie and the soldier.  The chapters get longer as if the author was not quite sure where to take the yarn as opposed to the earlier short crisp narratives.\n\nOnce the soldier leaves there are some descriptions of his life that are totally irrelevant and add nothing to the novel.  He returns to Franklin, and there is not much to his return either.\n\nI got the impression that the author knew the history of: a) Carrie's work in the hospital, then b) securing the bodies from the battlefield for her cemetery and last, c) running the cemetery.  However, he floundered getting from point a) to point b) so he manufactured this infatuation or love story.  It never seemed to have a point, meandered tediously and, ironically, it seemed to make the characters less sympathetic than they were before.  Carrie's husband was left out in left field throughout.  His character never to made any sense.  Two slaves who became free could have been wonderful cast members but were never developed.\n\nThe book was effective in relating the brutality of the Battle of Franklin and its aftermath.  The author was correct in his historical note that the story of Carrie, her manse and the graveyard are interesting.  However, the love story did not enhance the telling.  The Black Flower is a far better depiction of the Battle of Franklin and its hospital.  And, without a note, it apparently included a character based upon Carrie.  Bahr's \"Year of Jubilo\" is a better depiction of Franklin after the war.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

She felt it would have been an excellent non-fiction title (based on the true story of Carrie McGavock).\n\nAs fiction though, she dismisses it as \"an overwrought, overwritten novel that misses conveying the war's terrible reality and the courage of one woman.\" Somehow the author failed to \"perform that literary alchemy that transforms information into a believable plot and compelling characters.\" The reviewer points out the author's failure in keeping the language true to the time.\n\nPersonally I think it sounds worth a read, as long as the reader doesn't expect the heart-touching prose of Gone With the Wind or Cold Mountain.

Its a real mess, so I just wanted to make a note of it to help avoid confusion. This review is for KILLING FEAR...\n\nSeven years ago, Theodore Glenn was convicted of murdering four women and vowed revenge against those he held responsible for his incarceration. After a natural disaster occurs at San Quentin prison where he's being held, he escapes and heads south to begin his killing spree. Robin McKenna is a former stripper, current business owner, and the woman whose testimony helped put Glenn behind bars. Her ex-lover, Detective Will Hooper was the arresting officer, and both are on the top of this vicious and manipulative killer's hit list.\n\nFirst off, though this is book one in the Prison Break Trilogy, Ms. Brennan puts a lot of cross-over characters into her novels. Will Hooper actually made multiple appearances in the No Evil Trilogy, and for that reason I'd suggest reading 'Speak No Evil' first, which is his partner's story. Even better, I'd recommend reading all her stories chronologically since each one is thrilling in its own right and there are so many people you'll recognize from previous books. No worries though if you'd prefer not to, as this can definitely be read as a standalone.\n\nKilling Fear was a thrilling read which immediately grabbed my attention. At the start of this story I had a super hard time putting it down and figured it was a a five-star book for sure. However, although it was fast paced and never boring, I never really felt connected to either Will or Robin's characters. Glenn on the other hand, was a truly chilling individual whose obsession with Robin gave me the creeps. In the end I thought it was a very compelling romantic suspense, one I'm happy to have read and would easily recommend.", "Feedback": "positive"}

To that end she hires private eye Connor Kincaid, the man who helped Emily once before but who blames Julia for losing his job as a police officer. Working together they discover a string of murders, all connecting to an online therapy group. Just when Julia and Connor think they've figured it out there's another murder which proves otherwise. Julia however has been asking too many questions and making someone nervous. If they can't uncover the truth soon, she may be this twisted group's next chosen victim.\n\nThis book started out good but by the halfway point I hated whenever I was forced to put it down. Early on I thought I had the instigator figured out but I was wrong and I never did suspect who was leading this group of young killers. The plot was utterly unpredictable and had a lot going on which constantly kept me on my toes. I loved both Julia and Connor who had some history and hard feelings, but who also had an undeniable connection. Their chemistry and passion was breathtaking and I absolutely adored them as a couple. Getting into the minds of these young killers was frightening and often gruesome too. Overall it was a very graphic but gripping read and I can't wait for Dillon Kincaid's book next!", "Feedback": "positive"}

That's entirely due to the subject matter though which revolves around the kidnapping, rape and murder of 9-11 year old little girls. Needless to say, as a mother and aunt I had a difficult time dealing with some of the scenes. However, the writing was excellent as always, and had me bawling on a couple of occasions. This is the third and last in a series and can absolutely standalone, but I'd highly recommend 'The Prey' and most especially 'The Hunt' since the couple from that story play a large part in this one. I liked Zack and Olivia, though I had a harder time connecting with her character because of the aloofness she projected. The romance didn't seem to truly take root until the final quarter of the story, but I wound up really loving them as a couple. The ending was satisfying and although the serial child murderer gets his just reward, I felt a little conflicted over how it came about.

I have to admit that when I began this book, I became worried I wouldn't like it and that I was going to be offended as it starts out with characters who are extreme activists for animal and environmental rights and do violent, illegal things. I even skipped to the acknowledgments to see if Ms. Brennan had thanked anyone involved with animal or environmental rights and whether she had sought out their perspective. I didn't see that and that made me even more worried how this book would portray an issue I care deeply about - I am an animal rights activist and like most activists, believe in non-violence for all beings. But I continued on and was relieved to find that the story geared away from that and focused more on extremists with psychopathy.\n\nThe plot was good though not as exciting as previous books. This one was a bit more predictable but I still enjoyed the main character, Nora, and getting to know Duke Rogan. If I had to rank the books I've read so far, this one would fall at the bottom but I would be the first to say (as I wrote) that I am biased and that may be a factor. I think it would have been nice to have it clarified that the majority of people who believe that animals should not be killed for unnecessary things like food or clothing (and yes, even medical research) are not crazy or extreme but compassionate. I wasn't happy that the bio-tech researchers who keep innocent animals in captivity and make them sick and suffer were presented in a more favorable light than those who see the unfairness of that and believe that all life matters.\n\nFor people who are not sensitive to these issues, I think the book would be as well received as any of her others. I have given this book five stars because I can separate my personal feelings about the subject matter from the quality of the writing, which in Allison Brennan's case is always excellent. Allison Brennan is one of my favorite authors and I'm so happy to have found her books. I'm excited to get to finally move on to the Lucy Kincaid series.", "Feedback": "positive"}

However, I had been interested to read Jack's story since we first met him, so that could be why I liked the romantic angle in this book.  There was a lot more sexual tension between these 2 than has been typically present in the author's previous books.  I would have liked an epilogue explaining how these 2 juggled such different lives.  Maybe we'll find out later.  As for the plot-----it started out OK and kind of intriguing, but it seemed to become bogged down in details towards the end and became hard to follow at times. I only rated it as high as I did because I've got a little crush on Jack myself :-p  But, the book never resolved the issues he has with his father, or even explained them very well.

The romance was boring, and I hated the lovers-from-the-past theme.  The reason they split was stupid and juvenile, and.......really?  You're so in love with this woman (after all, he says he loves her about a thousand times with no response, which after awhile, just becomes pathetic) yet you stay away from her for 7 years, screwing every woman you can?  Then there's the fact that Will's character just didn't match what we've seen of him in other books.  He was a bumbling fool in this book.  And Robin?  Well, she was an immature bitch, and by chapter 40, she deserved to die for being such a weak, spineless idiot.  The plot was so-so, and the plot twist of two different murderers was unnecessary and distracting.  I've wasted a lot of money on this author.  Don't make the same mistake.\n\nP.S.

The romance aspect was fairly decent, but I hate the whole misunderstanding-from-the-past thing they had going.  Harkens back to my days watching soap operas.

True, Olivia was a bit annoying at times, but in my opinion, less so than the female leads in the other 2 books.  The plot, while disturbing, was fairly decent in terms of holding my interest.  I bought this trilogy because a character from the second book is the male lead in the first book of her next trilogy and I wanted his backstory before starting that trilogy.

Like her writing style, her voice, the way she weaves romance into her gripping suspense stories.\n\nSee No Evil: 5.00:\nFour sentences in this book struck a very personal chord, thus it became a very engrossing, moving, heart-felt story.\n\n \"I should have fought harder for custody.  But I'm just her aunt.  I know the law.  It was stacked against me.\"  (Julia, page 59)\n\nHero: 4.0:\nConnor Kincaid: It was impossible not to feel drawn to this rule-breaking, hot-blooded, hunk of a man who was described as \"a pit bull when he cared about something.\"  By the end of the book, Connor had resolved the issues tied to his bitterness that overwhelmed him because he had to resign from a job he loved (San Diego Police Department) when he was forced to testify against his brothers in blue.\n\nHeroine: 4.5:\nJulia Chandler: A gorgeous deputy district attorney with a take-no-prisoners reputation, who fought for what she believed in.  It was impossible not to admire a heroine who would not back down -- to anyone.  But . . . she was willing to break the law to save her niece.\n\nStory Line: 4.5:\nA uniquely fascinating tale about a villain with a God complex, who manipulated four emotionally wounded teens to kill so he could wreck vengeance without getting his own hands bloody.  When Julia's niece, Emily, was suspected of killing her abusive stepfather, Judge Victor Montgomery, she called Connor, a private investigator, to prove Emily's innocence -- even though she was instrumental in the destruction of his career five years ago.\n\nAction: 4.0:\nThe story line moved at a fast pace as the villain moved the teens around his chess board and Julia, Connor, Dillon, and Will investigated the deaths that were the result of an e-group called Wishlist.\n\nEmotion: 4.0:\nAlthough not as intense as expected because of the way Brennan drew me into this story, it was impossible not to feel sympathy and compassion for so many of the characters; namely, {1} Connor, {2} Julia, {3} Emily, and, surprisingly, {4} Faye.\n\nRomance: 4.0:\nThere was a stronger feeling of romance in this book than in Brennan's previous four.  Brennan had a kiss that Connor and Julia shared five years before with which to work.  The fireworks between Connor and Julia bespoke of strong feelings that could not be suppressed.\n\nSensuous: 3.5:\nLots of sizzle, heat, and sensuality were present when Connor and Julia made love.\n\nSuspense: 5.0:\nBrennan is a master when it comes to developing a story that keeps readers on the edge of their seats as they try to figure out who the villain might be -- right along with the main characters.\n\nSecondary Characters:  5.0:\nThe secondary characters ranged from rich, well-developed characters to barely-there members, but they added great depth to this story.  Liked the continued inclusion of the Kincaid family by including: {1} Dillon Kincaid (the psychiatrist), {2} Patrick Kincaid (the e-crimes guru), {3} homicide detective Will Hooper (an honorary Kincaid), and {4} District Attorney Andrew Stanton (the ex-brother-in-law).  The villains all added to the rich suspenseful flavor necessary for this story: {1} the number one villain (even though he remained unidentified), {2} the co-villain (who also remained unidentified), {3} Faye Kessler, the most heart-breaking teen villain, {4} Camilla \"Cami\" Wohler, the most cold-blooded teen villain, {5} Dennis \"Skip\" Richardson, Jr., a minor teen villain, and {6} Robert \"Robbie\" Haxton, the other minor teen villain.  Julia's relatives were necessary additions: {1} Emily Chandler Montgomery, her niece, and {2} Crystal Montgomery, Emily's mother (the gold-digger).  And, last, but definitely not least were two intriguing additions: {1} Selene Borge and {2} Billy Thompson.\n\nSee Wolf Bear Does Books for a more in-depth, detailed review of *See No Evil*.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Except that this story went on a bit too long after the exciting 'this should have been the big finale' scene.\n\nHero: 4.0:\nZack Thomas: A Seattle Homicide Detective who is sexy, protective, caring, confident, determined and every romance reader's dream come true:\n\n. . . . . If there was one thing Zack Travis knew, it was women.  When to touch.  Where to touch.  How to touch.  (page 79) . . . . .\n\nHeroine: 4.5:\nOlivia St. Martin: The strong-willed, intelligent director of Trace Evidence and Materials Analysis at FBI's Virginia-based laboratory who hides her compassion, obsession, and determination behind a faade of ice.  It was easy to identify with Olivia and understand her emotional angst.\n\nStory Line: 5.0:\nWhat an exciting premise around which to revolve a story.  A little girl loses her big sister to a killer and from that moment on her life is never the same.  Through science, she is driven to find justice for all victims of crime.  When she finds out she helped incarcerate an innocent man for killing her sister, she stops at nothing to find the actual killer.  She poses as an FBI Agent to insert herself into the Seattle Police Department's investigation of a serial killer -- believing him to be the man who killed her sister.\n\nAction: 4.0:\nThe story begins to soar as Zack and Olivia head up the investigation into The Seattle Slayer.  The action in this book, however, is more in the line of police procedural events than exciting adventurous scenes such as car chases and the like.\n\nEmotion: 4.7:\nBrennan is amazing as she weaves such deep emotion into a story about a monster.  The emotion in this story is rich for several reasons. {1} Who cannot help but hate a serial killer who rapes and kills little girls?  {2} Brennan richly details the devastation that the families of the slain girls experience -- concentrating on Olivia's crumbling steel walls of control.\n\nRomance: 4.5:\nThe awareness that arched between Zack and Olivia was never left in doubt.  Zack was attracted to Olivia in spite of the \"don't touch\" signals she broadcast.  Olivia's walls of emotional protection began to collapse and a deep romantic connection built as she spent more time with Zack.\n\nSensuous: 3.0:\nBrennan knows how to include spice, heat, passion and emotion in her love scenes.\n\nSuspense: 4.0:\nThe suspense was constant and became more intense as the story progressed.  Brennan painted such a complex, controlled, astute picture of The Seattle Slayer and his ability to evade detection, that she had readers wondering how Zack, Olivia and their team were going to catch this slippery predator.\n\nSecondary Characters: 4.5:\nBrennan seems to really get into the heads of her supporting characters.  She did a phenomenal job of making both The Seattle Slayer (the true villain) and Brian Harrison Hall (the circumstantial villain) very multi-faceted.  Although not as well developed as these two men, the other supporting characters in the book came to life with concise descriptions and minimal appearances.  It was nice to get a picture of Quinn and Miranda Peterson's future when they were included in the story.\n\nSee Wolf Bear Does Books for a more in-depth, detailed review of *The Kill*.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Yes, there is a mystery.  Yes, this is Duke Rogan's story.  Was I disappoointed?  Yes!!!  First of all the story starts out twenty yrs ago with a couple of revolutionaries who were blowing up buildings.  The daughter turns her mom and stepdad into the FBI.  The daughter, Nora, falls in love with her FBI contact, who is murdered by her stepdad.  Her mom is sent to prison and Nora and her sister to child services.

{"ReviewerID": "ABXZMKZUIVBTI", "ProductID": "B000FCKPG2", "Review": "Not really romance, more just suspense I generally love Allison Brennan and while her books are never heavy on the romance, this book held almost no romance. For at least the first 1/3 of the book Jack and Megan don't even have any interactions with each other. When they finally meet it's instant attraction and jumping into headlong into a full blown relationship. I don't have a problem with that sort of quick falling in love, but in this book it seemed like an after thought thrown in there with little development. Even after Jack and Megan meeting and instantly fall in love there isn't enough interactions between the 2 to really draw me into the story.\n\nAs a straight novel of suspense, it was good. I gave it 3 stars for a few reasons though:\n\n1. I really was expecting more romance if this was going to be marketed as a romantic suspense\n2. The extensive, graphic attention devoted to the torture of the victims and the sexual pleasure the killers get from the torture was disturbing. I don't mind some torture scenes but Brennan described in great detail multiple torture scenes to the point where it finally made me uncomfortable and I started skipping the scenes devoted to the killers.\n3. I understand that giving insight into the killers is a great device when telling a good mystery/suspense novel but I felt she gave too much attention to the killers. Some of the scenes felt repetitive and too detailed. Maybe I feel that way because I don't normally read strict suspense novels, but I would have liked it more if there were less pages on the killers and more on the development of Jack and Megan's relationship.\n4. The conflict between Hans and Megan seemed forced and could have been developed better I think.\n\nIf you go into this novel understanding you're not getting much romance and that there's graphic, at times disturbing scenes of torture, then you'll probably like this book more than I did. I just really wasn't prepared for what I got in this book.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

{"ReviewerID": "A1CNQTCRQ35IMM", "ProductID": "B000FCKPG2", "Review": "This was labeled romance but there was less romance than I expected.  It was ok as mystery suspense (warning: a lot of torture). REVIEWER'S OPINION:\nThis was labeled as romantic suspense, and the mislabeling is what bothers me the most.  In my opinion, it does not have enough romance or development of a relationship to qualify for that genre.  This is mostly mystery suspense with a lot of uncomfortable torture scenes.  95% of the story is about the authorities finding clues and slowly unraveling the mystery about serial killings.  The small amount of romance consists of a couple meeting, working together on the case, and getting together at the end.  I didn't get the feelings of anticipation or enjoyment that I normally expect from \"romance\" novels.  Once in a while I will enjoy a straight mystery because the characters pull me in, or the dialogue is interesting, or I feel good while reading it.  But this book didn't have those effects on me.  I think mystery lovers will like this more than I did.\n\nI had a minor problem with the smart good guys doing a couple of stupid or illogical things.  Megan was stupid and careless toward the end which caused a major problem.  Hans was angry at Megan for reasons I felt did not make sense or fit with his character.\n\nSTORY BRIEF:\nMegan is a by-the-book FBI agent investigating veterans who had been tortured and killed.  Jack is a former veteran and now a soldier-for-hire.  He joins with Megan to find the killers after his best friend is killed (one of the victims).  We learn early in the story who the killers are (Ethan and Karin) so I'm not giving anything away.  Ethan was with a group of soldiers in Afghanistan.  He was captured and tortured for three months by the Taliban before being rescued.  He is suicidal and loaded with mental problems.  Karin wants to learn torture techniques, but Ethan won't teach her.  Therefore she convinces Ethan that he needs to capture and torture the veterans who were with him at the time, saying they abandoned him.  She plans and helps him capture the vets, and then learns by watching Ethan stick needles into them.  The main mystery is finding the killers, but a second mystery is why Karin wants to learn to torture.\n\nDATA:\nStory length: 424 pages.  Swearing language: strong.  Sexual language: moderate.  Number of sex scenes: 2.  Total number of sex scene pages: 12.  Setting: California, Texas, Colorado and Arizona.  Copyright: 2009.  Genre: mystery suspense.", "Feedback": "negative"}

The plot sounded interesting & I liked the premise. My only problem? The writing just didn't live up to the storyline.\n\nThe story surrounds a beautiful DA Julia who must prove her niece's innocence after her stepfather is found horribly murdered in his study. A stepfather whom the niece was being molested by & had plenty of motive to kill. There to help is a figure from Julia's past who holds a grudge and a lot of lust against her, Connor Kinkaid. Moving in the background however is a mysterious group of youths who will stop at nothing to keep their plan moving, even as their shadowy leader pulls their strings.\n\nThis story had so many flaws to it. First off, the characters were interesting in theory, but I just couldn't find myself really getting into the main characters. Connor was fine, but Julia just seemed lackluster. The most interesting characters were the ones never fully explored. The other major flaw is the lack of buildup for who the leader is, why he wanted so many people dead, & how he discovered everyone and pulled them together. His real identity isn't even introduced until the last part of the book & didn't really fit with the story. (He showed up before then, but only as the villain. His persona wasn't introduced or anything until the last part of the book.)\n\nFor that matter, the reasons & wherefores for the rest of the kids aren't ever really explained either. We're *told* that they're all angsty rich kids who were abused (small spoiler, but not really), but it just never seems enough to really explain why they'd do any of that. In the end Brennan goes for the old standard of \"They're crazy, so that's their reasoning\". When we finally *do* get the reasons why, they're so farfetched & unsubstantiated that I found it hard to think of it as a real reason or find it very shocking. There just wasn't any buildup for those revelations, so the ending fell flat. While many would find this entertaining enough to keep them occupied, there's just not enough for me to recommend it as a \"must read\". This is the type of book you pick up when there's nothing else there at the thrift store, not new off the shelves.\n\n2.9/5", "Feedback": "moderate"}

During the course of the investigation Will met and fell in love with Robin McKenna.  She was one of the strippers at RJ's, Theodore glenn killed four other strippers who were her friends before he was caught. The last one was her roommate. Robin found her and has nightmares still, about falling over the body and sliding through the blood.\n\nWill is a detective with the SFPD, he is divorced and has only had short affairs with other women since he lost Robin. Will lost her trust when he didn't believe her about Glenn. She never had an affair with him. Will finds that the news of Glenn's escape brings back all the feelings for Robin and when he sees her, he knows he will do everything he can to protect her and if he is lucky win her back into his arms.\n\nRobin started stripping to pay for college, but every man she has dated has equated stripping with prostitution. She has lost all trust in men until she met Will. She opened her heart to him and thought he trusted her, but his questions about her relationship with Glenn destroyed what trust and love she had for him. Now Robin owns RJ's and it is an uptown night club. Very chic and understated the club has been rebuilt and refurnished while the area was undergoing a rejuvenation.

The best solution so far is to make sure that there are sufficient hyperlinks for notes, table of contents and anything else one might want to temporarily refer to. The separate Article List and Section Lists can do a pretty good job of this if implemented intelligently.\n\nThe WSJ \"Whats News\" listings used to be on Kindle as a separate section, with its own article list that included the first line of an article and each article was hyperlinked. There were duplicate listings of articles under the various section headings, but so what? You could easily find what interested you to read first.\n\nNow the \"What's News\" listings are all under \"Page One\", with the articles listed in a hard to read series as a single paragraph (a bulleted list would at least be some improvement), with no hyperlinks for the individual articles.\n\nThen THAT Page One \"paragraph\" is hyperlinked to where you finally get the original individual article hyperlinks from a headline cum first line listing. This means more clicking, more levels to find what you want. A very counter productive time consuming change. An \"improvement\" it's not.\n\nBad idea No. 2: The reduction of sections listed in the Kindle \"Section List\" - my preferred default state rather than the article list - no longer includes a \"Letters and Opinion\" Section. Instead the letters and Editorials and Op-Eds are just at the end of the huge continuous \"Page One\" section listing, so you have to page through the whole Page One list to get to the editorial content.\n\nThis change is another time-consuming annoyance that also suggests that the new regime at the WSJ doen't understand the basic concept of journalism that \"news/facts/reportage\" and \"editorial/opinon\" content are not the same thing. The old system made it clear what was what, which gave the reader some confidence that the owners, editors and reporters also were clear on the distinction. Bad move, WSJ.\n\nI also second the complaints about the cost: they could at least throw in the web subscription for the price of the Kindle edition, although I do use the WSJ mobile web version with the Kindle browser to get the market data page.\n\nAlong with the NYTimes, the WSJ is still one of the better Kindle periodical implementations, but it could have been improved; instead we got the opposite.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A1JV4QKTEB7QBL", "ProductID": "B000GCFBXS", "Review": "Dietary Pluralism Co-owner and chef of Primo restaurant in Rockland Maine, Melissa Kelly enthusiastically espouses the Mediterranean lifestyle in her new book, \"Mediterranean Women Stay Slim, Too\", an obvious take-off of the mega bestseller, \"French Women Don't Get Fat\" by Mireille Giuliano.  Rather than focusing on the epicure wonders of one country, Kelly shoots for the melting-pot American approach of multiculturalism and sails the wine-dark sea in search of a metaphorically food-loving Ithaca.\n\nUnlike Giuliano's vignette-styled success, Kelly takes a foodie's approach:  food snobbery and sheer gastronomical delight reign supreme tempered with gluttonless slow eating and small portion sizes.  Her best tip?  Special treats like a scoop of gelato shouldn't be eaten every day, but when one indulges the three-bite rule should be enforced; delight in only three bites and then stop before excess rules over commonsense.\n\nKelly's book cruises along tracking other `real food' diet/lifestyle road maps like the \"Sonoma\" and \"Fat Fallacy\" regimes.  If there is a difference its intaglio is the wealth of recipes that Kelly includes from seasonal staple dishes from menus of her famous restaurant composed of fresh ingredients facilitated by Primo's own vegetable and herb gardens.  After explaining her Italian-American rearing on Long Island (you go girl---I am also an Italian American from Old Bethpage), she divides the book into familiar components---forgive my explanatory license here.  Topics like `high flavor', `variety', `olive oil', `the market and garden', `tapas portions', `whole grain', `meat control', `eating at the family table', `water and wine', `eating little but eating well',  `heart healthy', `living a small rural life', provide a glimmer into the svelte world of the archetypical Mediterranean woman with the addition of health factoids and individual stories that are geared to launch the convenience driven American mindset into a landscape resplendent with a cornucopia of good choices and the breathing room to utterly enjoy and savor the options.\n\nAlthough not your typical diet book replete with dietary dos and don'ts, Kelly does round out her information with a nuts and bolts chapter that answers the obvious questions of how? how much? and when? with a seven day-menu planner that controls portions, includes the wholesome foods discussed in the previous chapters and adds a little meat for a little excitement.\n\nAlong with this, she plugs the idea of balance and contentment which seems to embody the Mediterranean woman and calls to mind that relaxed feeling that one gets even after a short two week trip abroad.  Even though she admits that life in America seems very far away from life in the Mediterranean, she asserts that she \"almost [has] it right\" bolstering her opinion with Charlotte Cushman's words \"To try to be better is to be better.\"\n\nKelly's chatty style reflects the ease she employs to welcome us into her quasi-Mediterranean world.  At times her enthusiasm runs amok and she falls into the same annoying foreign language usage utilized by Mireille Giuliano in FWDGF.  Overtly, Mireille shamelessly uses her `French-ness' to charm her super-sized American audience; sadly Kelly's pseudo sophistication runs the foreign phrase gamut using too-cutesy italicized comments from Gibraltar to Lebanon that annoy rather than instruct and detract from otherwise good information.\n\nBottom line?  While Melissa Kelly's all-American pluralistic approach in \"Mediterranean Women Stay Slim, Too\" works well on the level of providing good information and interesting recipes, it seems that the current marketplace is saturated with so many books advocating real food and slow eating that they all seem to cover the same ground.  Under the guise of learning the newest need-to-know slenderizing secrets of different cultures, we learn only a few simple facts:  Eat well, eat slowly and enjoy life.  Recommended to those who would appreciate some staple Mediterranean recipes.\n\nDiana F. Von Behren\n\n\"reneofc\"", "Feedback": "moderate"}

I ordered it and decided to make it my entree for summer reading. By nibbling on it and picking off pieces of it, I've managed to make it last for over a month. In many ways, it was a perfect summer read, for a person who couldn't travel herself. Mayes took me to places I've always wanted to go, Portugal, Spain, Greece, even Turkey and North Africa. But the book annoyed me, too. Mayes seemed hypercritical, judgmental off-and-on about her accomodations and her meals. She jumped around while describing her setting so that I felt like I was looking at her world through the eye of a jerky video camera. Yet she also wrote poetically at times, describing foods she ate and places she visited so beautifully that I felt I'd eaten, too, that I'd travelled with her. The last chapter is a wonderful summing up of the need to travel that could equally well apply to the need to read as well. Mayes reminds us of T.S. Eliot's idea that in voyaging, we come back to our beginnings and understand our own world for the first time. A good reason to travel. A good reason to read.", "Feedback": "positive"}

She, herself, a tourist, hated the fact that other people thought as much to visit the same places. There is a lot of foreign words, terms and phrases to get through. She ate so much food and the descriptions of each meal abound, page after heart-stopping, artery-clogging page. I had no idea I picked up a book about food. If I had, I would have spent my money on something else. I also was offended by several of her remarks/reference about the limited number of black people she came in contact with.

I'm finished reading it now, months later. As with a few of the other reviewers, I found it very difficult to get through it. The first half was mostly food reviews and discourses. I was hoping for the wit and one sentence capturing of people and places that she used in her previous books. Not much of what she wrote made me want to visit Portugal, Spain, Naples, Fez and Burgundy. I too was a bit appalled by her lack of understanding for her fellow passengers on the Greek cruise. She had a free trip and basically denigrated the experience. Cruises aren't for everyone, but hey, most of us wouldn't turn down a free one and would try and find the best parts of the experience rather than wallowing in the worst.\n\nIt wasn't until she hit the British Isles that her obsession with food lessened and she became the writer I loved from Under the Tuscan Sun. I did question some of her reviews of British food. I have rarely eaten anything to rave about in England, Scotland and Ireland. It is good solid food and enjoyable, but not something to send one to lala land over the taste and texture and experience. She also managed to bring the beauty of the gardens that the UK is so famous for to me through her words. That redeemed the poorly presented first half of the book in my eyes!\n\nIn the preface she says that she and Ed quit their jobs to write and to explore new possibilities (which includes travel). I do hope future books are a little more rounded. I know that this is more of a memoir than a travelogue in many ways, but it would have been nice to have had a more cohesive picture of the country they were currently visiting rather than constant descriptions of hanging sheep heads and the way to cook them. For me at least, the lyrical beauty of food in her Tuscan books, was just not there for me in this one. Sometimes her descriptions of the places she and Ed were visiting seemed thrown in beside the wonders of their culinary adventures. She obviously feels that understanding the foods and wines/drinks of a place are important to understanding the culture. It just would have been nice if there had been more culture, more people, more descriptions of places than of vegetables and the quest for a perfect espresso.\n\nAnd all this talk of food makes me wonder why she and Ed aren't at least 300 pounds! I've seen Ms. Mayes at a book fair and she is not overweight and not slender model size--just normal. In reading the first half of the book, I found myself wondering how much weight she must have gained!

{"ReviewerID": "A13E0ARAXI6KJW", "ProductID": "B000GCFCNC", "Review": "Under the Tuscan Shadow Lies a Hopscotch Tour of Europe and the Mediterranean I think the best travel essay books transcend the logistics of roaming through exotic locations to bring out a strong narrative thread that illuminates themes more resonant than the author's own self-discovery. Author Frances Mayes achieved a universal sense of liberation and self-acceptance with her most famous book, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\", but despite her immense gift in conveying  the images of foreign cultures, she falls a bit short with her latest collection of essays. Timing also works against her as fellow writer Elizabeth Gilbert has recently come out with her own revealing diary of a year traveling abroad with \"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia\".\n\nWhereas Gilbert undergoes a cathartic experience that transforms her from an urban-dwelling workaholic, Mayes - having already experienced her own catharsis in refurbishing a 900-year old Tuscan villa - already seems well prepared for the pleasures and hazards of travel and often comes across as a dilettante in the way she and her husband Ed hopscotch the globe in search of a feeling of home all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Giving up the security of their tenured university positions, the couple covers quite a bit of ground, and in fact, each chapter represents a unique locale and consequently an idiosyncratic experience. As if hosting a travel series, they go to museums that range from the world-renowned Prado in Madrid to a Welsh museum filled with over one thousand teapots. In a less adventurous vein than Anthony Bourdain, they also dine on the local cuisine whether it is churros in Sevilla or Sally Lunn bread in the Cotswolds or Ed's constant quest for the perfect espresso. Academics at heart, they immerse themselves into the local literature to ensure they are not ignorant before coming to landmarks of historical or cultural significance.\n\nHowever, as with Gilbert's book, the best passages in Mayes' book have to do with the local people that she and Ed meet and get to know. Mayes has a particular talent in describing unique characters like the aggressive, multilingual Istanbul rug dealer who sends notes in miniature looms or the Fez tour guide who loves to quote from Joseph Conrad. These are the people that bring the book to life. Frances and Ed, on the other hand, seem like observers, thoughtful tour guides for the upscale traveler. The author seems to be taking a page from Alain de Botton's \"The Art of Travel\" where he waxes fondly on the multitude of epiphanies brought about by one's own voyaging and mixing the resulting experiences with observations made by the great artists and writers. I just think Mayes doesn't quite elucidate those epiphanies at a meaningful enough level given the hodgepodge approach of their journey.", "Feedback": "positive"}

It focuses on a 38 year old woman aptly named Jane Fortune, a female who has become rather set in her ways, losing hope of ever finding love, let alone true happiness. Her life is rather lackluster. How and why will she change? Or will she? That is the main issue but the various subplots are what make this book a special treat. Horowitz throws in little gems of insight, much as Austen did. This book will make you think about society's conventions - or perhaps make you wonder about the loss of them.\n\n  The author of this book, Laurie Horowitz, includes a special section where she explains how she came to write the book and why she deviated from the conventions of Austen novels. Basically, she has created a thoughtful, compelling book which takes into account the way society has changed since Austen's time - women actually work outside the home, they may be more independent, etc.\n\n  What I found intriguing was how Horowitz managed to have a strong, independent female (Jane Fortune) at the heart of this book while still maintaining the mannered tone of an Austen novel, quite a feat to pull off. She does this by setting her tale in Boston, a city which still has its share of people who care about social class. She shows the subtle distinctions between those with old money and those who are newly wealthy, but does so with taste and a deft touch. Jane Fortune is one of those who come from old-money aristocracy but who is feeling more and more out of date, feeling that managing a trust fund and the family foundation may not be her life's goal. Her \"charmed life\" is beginning to feel more and more like a cage and not the Eden it used to be. She also misses the love of her life (who, thank goodness, is about to appear again).\n\n  I found Jane Fortune to be compelling, although some readers might find her reserved, haughty and a bit too judgmental. For me, however, she had a keen eye, a willingness to face her weaknesses and (usually) the good sense to bite her tongue for the sake of peace. Mostly, though, I savored this book for the similarities to Austen, with just enough difference to hold my interest.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Yes, its numbered as one, but from my understanding, the author went back and wrote this farther into the series, although I have no idea how far in she was when she wrote it. I guess that means when I read book 2 first, out of order(I thought), I was really reading the first one that came out? Confusing yes, but it doesnt even matter as I think any of these can be read as a standalone if need be.\n\nGreg Hewitt is working late at his office where he is a psychologist. When he leaves, he finds himself climbing into the trunk of a car even though all he is thinking about is his upcoming vacation. Quite the beginning! Lissianna Argeneau arrives at her mothers home for her birthday party and makes a quick stop in her old bedroom. There she finds her birthday present tied to her bed. And that is a very abbreviated version of how the hero and heroine of this book meet.\n\nLissianna is part of the huge Argeneau family of vampires, based in Toronto. Shes smart, caring, and a good person. She is a social worker for a homeless shelter and really cares for the people there. Shes actually very human with the exception of what makes her a vampire. She is a born vampire and has never been dead. Theres actually a very creative back story for these vampires and how they came to be. These aren't your normal bloodthirsty devils or even the glittery kind. At over two hundred years old, she still looks to be about twenty five. Greg is pretty much a workaholic and hasn't taken a vacation in years. Hes around thirty five, handsome, and very intelligent. Lissianna and Greg are immediately attracted to each other, although I still am not sure why Greg isn't fighting desperately to get out of the house. Compelled? Yes, but with a strong mind that they cant keep under control. There is actually a huge cast of characters besides these two. Its a house party weekend for Lissiannas birthday, so we meet a lot of the Argeneau family in this book. My favorite of all was Lissiannas cousin Thomas, probably her closest friend and fellow conspirator in all things fun. If I can find a book with him as a main character, it will probably be my next read in this series. As with any of these books that I have previously read, there is of course, a villain. And I am going to leave it at that.\n\nThis was a good romance with a bit of a mystery that morphed into a thriller at times. But most of all, this was just a fun read. Theres humor, good characters, and a bit of steamy romance. As with the previous books, I really enjoyed the world building as well. Did it have a deep intricate plot? Not so much, and that was perfectly alright. I have thoroughly enjoyed myself with every one of these reads and this book was no exception. I could however, tell the difference from this book and the latest of her books that I have read. I think the series has definitely gotten better as it progressed. The recent books are really exciting, almost thriller reads, and this one was a bit more sedate. There is a place for both kinds of reads in a series that is this long, at least I think so.\n\nHighly recommended to adult paranormal romance readers.

I liked the story except there wasn't any Chemistry between  Lissianna and Greg. They weren't even sure they were life mates.

I was wondering the whole book if it was going to be a turn given up for the wrong person. I was confused on her sharing her pleasure with others she had bitten, not the mind control to make them not realize the pain but she was sharing the pleasure she was getting out of it?

{"ReviewerID": "A2EU9VP0MRMUGE", "ProductID": "B000GCFWXW", "Review": "Argeneau book 1 Lissianna has an unusual problem for a vampire - she faints at the sight of blood! As you can imagine that makes life extremely difficult for her and her family are all worried about how hard it is for her to feed. Her mother decides to take matters into her own hands and she kidnaps a psychologist who specialises in phobias so that he can help Lissianna get over her fears. Things start to go wrong when Lissianna wrongly assumes that Greg is her dinner rather than her doctor but surely one quick bite isn't going to do any harm?\n\nI've been wanting to try the Argeneau series for such a long time now so when I was offered a review copy of A Quick Bite I was really excited and couldn't wait to get started. I'm a huge paranormal romance fan, it's one of my go to genres and I'll never get tired of reading about vampires and other creatures that go bump in the night. I picked this up expecting a fairly light and funny read along the lines of Katie MacAlister's Dark Ones series and I have to say for the first couple of chapters I thought that was exactly what I had got but unfortunately the humour got old very fast and I ended up hating most of the characters.\n\nLissianna is a 200 year old vampire but along with her cousins (some of whom are even older than she is!) she acts like a 12 year old tween most of the time. They were all just so incredibly childish that it was hard to take any of them seriously and I ended up getting really annoyed with all of them. The way they all kept spying on Lissianna and Greg was just creepy and so was the way everyone could read his mind and know that he was constantly thinking how hot she was. I just got very tired of all the erection jokes! On the subject of Greg I thought is reactions to the situation he found himself in were completely unbelievable. He wakes up in a strange house tied to the bed after arriving in very unusual circumstances yet he's more interested in the thought of being the beautiful stranger's willing sex slave than he is about trying to escape. We get told a lot about how attracted they are to each other but if I'm honest I just didn't feel the chemistry between them, it all felt very clinical and there wasn't enough of a build up for me to feel invested in their relationship.\n\nAlthough this story is mainly focused on the romance there was also a bit of a suspense plot in the background with someone attempting to murder Lissianna. That could have added something to the book and made it much more interesting apart from the fact that a five year old would have been able to tell you who was behind the attempt pretty much the first time we met their character. It was so completely obvious that the perpetrator might as well have been walking around with \"I'm a Vampire Hunter\" tattooed across their forehead yet Lissianna didn't once think to question their weird behaviour. To put it politely Lissianna is an idiot, I think this quote says it all:\n\nLissianna shook her head, thinking it was rather amazing she'd survived to reach two hundred if she'd made many mistakes like that over the years.\n\nHonestly I'm not sure how she made it to 200 either, she made so many stupid mistakes when it came to feeding that I stopped counting them but I feel like I spent half the book rolling my eyes at her.\n\nI'm just so disappointed that this book didn't work for me because I had such high hopes for it in the beginning. I am kind of tempted to give the next book a try though, first books in a series can always be a bit hit and miss and since this series is still going strong after 24 books have been published there must be something good about it. So I may give it a second chance at some point but unfortunately I don't think I'll be in any rush, not when there are so many other books on my TBR pile that I'm actually excited about reading.\n\nSource: Received from Gollancz in exchange for an honest review", "Feedback": "negative"}

I'm a big fan of Lynsay Sands and am well on my way to having read all of her historicals. I have the majority done but am saving those last few to pull me out of reading slumps. If you haven't read her historicals yet, I suggest giving them a shot in audio. She has great narrators that really bring the characters for life. Back to the book at hand, I don't know why I haven't tried the Argeneau series before now. It may be because I tend to search out urban fantasy series because I like to follow the same couple throughout... but I have run through those and now am going back to the paranormal multi-couple series such as Argeneau, Immortals After Dark, etc.\n\nThis book was a little different from other vampy books that I have read and listened to in that our hero was not the fangy one. Dr. Gregory Hewitt is a psychologist that specializes in the treatment of phobias. He seems to be a bit of a workaholic and his sister is constantly setting him up on blind dates. He manages to get out of the latest fix up because he is all set to go on vacation to Cancun, his first vacation in many years. Unfortunately before he can do any relaxing, Greg is spirited away by a female vamp who plans to give him to her daughter as a birthday present!\n\nOur heroine is also unique, Lissianna Argeneau is a 200 y/o vamp who suffers from hemophobia. She faints at the sight of blood. This has made Lissianna largely dependent on her family for feeding. So when she sees great bound to her bed with a bow, she mistakes him for dinner! They couple has an instant connection it seems, and Greg is the first mortal whose mind is closed to Lissianna.\n\nAs Greg proves to have a strong will, the vamps are at odds regarding his fate and future. He needs to treat Lissianna's phobia... but danger seems to find them at every turn. This was a light-hearted paranormal. It wasn't a dark fantasy with broody vamps and overly serious characters, but it was entertaining despite being somewhat shallow. I don't mean that in a negative way.\n\nSo I liked the story, but I didn't love it. I honestly think it was the beta male thing. I like my vamps to be dark, broody and dominant. Greg is pretty much the opposite of those characteristics. Maybe some of the other Argeneau brothers will tickle my fang fancy... but I will keep reading regardless because I know I am going to be entertained with any book by Lynsay.\n\nSince this was an audio, I feel like I should say something about the narrator. It was a solid performance. Nothing stuck out as good or bad. My mind did wander off a few times that required me to rewind... but that was more about me being busy than the book not holding my interest.\n\n3 stars / 3 flames.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2VIQGN7FYVZ2E", "ProductID": "B000GCFWXW", "Review": "I had high hopes but was disappointed. Recently, Ive been in a contemporary romance reading slump, so Ive been diving into paranormal romances instead, and the Argeneau series was brought to my attention via an Avon newsletter. I was interested in one of the newer titles in the series, but I decided to go back and start with the first book in the series. I was excited because as a whole, the series seems to be well praised. And the synopsis of the first book, A Quick Bite, is intriguing and offers a unique story line for a vampire read. But, while I didn't hate the book, I did find myself disappointed with it.\n\nA Quick Bite introduces us to the Argeneau family, but the focus is on Lissianna Argeneau, a hundreds of years old vampire who tends to faint at the sight of blood. Like, how awesome is that? Here we have a vampirea species that needs blood in order to survivethat cant stand even seeing the tiniest drop of blood. How does she combat that? How is she surviving? Its actually quite a humorous set up, and I thoroughly enjoy the idea of a vampire who is afraid of blood.\n\nIn an effort to help Lissianna overcome her fear, her mother kidnaps Dr. Gregory Hewitta doctor who specializes in phobiasto give to Lissianna as a birthday present. The only thing is, Lissianna doesnt realize that the hot guy tied to her bed is a birthday present that is NOT there for her tasting pleasure. Who can blame her for wanting to take a quick bite from Gregs delicious-looking neck? Once she finds out that Greg is there to help her overcome her phobia, Lissianna is in shock. Did she just accidentally seduce her doctor? Ummmyeah. And shes also in shock that Greg isn't calm and serene like the people her mother normally compels to bring home. Hes very much aware of the fact that hes been kidnapped, and hes not okay with iteven if there is a sexy, vixen vampire offering him more passion than hes ever felt before.\n\nLissianna feels so bad about what her mother has done, that she helps Greg escape and takes him back to his home. Yet, somehow, they keep finding themselves together again. Because now Lissianna must protect Greg from her uncle who has the power to turn his brain to mush.\n\nI was honestly so disappointed in the direction this story went. It became more about protecting Greg from a threat that ultimately wasn't a real threata threat that distracted them from the real threat, which was so obvious to me as a reader that I couldn't understand how Lissianna was missing it. She wasn't very intelligent. And Lissiannas phobia was forgotten for a big part of the story, and when it was addressed, it was addressed in a poor and uneventful way. I guess I was just expecting that to be a bigger part of the story, and I don't knowI just wasn't excited by this read. Sure, the sexual chemistry was there, but I was off-put by what felt like a case of insta-love. Furthermore, I felt like Gregs feelings toward having to leave his family if he wanted to be with Lissianna were not complex enough and not realistic. I mean, I know Im reading a paranormal romanceI don't expect it to be realistic, but I do expect it try to aim for some sense of relatability.\n\nThe writing was just sub-par, and I did find it difficult to keep all of the cousins straight at times. But I will say that I will eventually continue with this series. Lissiannas brothers and Thomas intrigued me, and I have a feeling that the writing and storylines will improve. Maybe Ill even grow to like Lissianna and Greg as I get to know them more. I guess we will see!\n\nOriginally reviewed at Bridget's Book Bungalow.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Not a bad place to start when reading a paranormal romance.  However, as the universe of this novel is described, I got disgusted, as the vampires are more cyborgs than vampires, perhaps they can be best described as vampiric cyborgs.  However, even if I could have gotten over that issue, I came against another one, this is a Pollyanna vampire story.  Everyone is NICE and helpful.

However, this felt like one of those old black and white movies where one of the gang has a problem and everyone gathers together for a sing along and by the end everything is fixed and everyone is happy even the old curmudgeon.\n\nIf you like a Harlequin Romance with a toe just this side of the Vampire line, then the story telling is OK and it's not a bad read.

I especially enjoyed how the characters got to know one another as people before getting into bed together or professing their love for one another.\n\nIn my opinion, A Quick Bite was better than the most recent book, The Immortal Who Loved Me. I cant say yet about all the other ones in between. I plan to read the next one in the series soon.\n\nI don't have anything negative to say about this book. I have read some reviews that say the characters are not developed enough. I didn't think so. All of the characters, even the minor ones, felt like real people to me. Lynsay Sands does a great job with romance and character development.\n\nThe mythology wasn't anything unique, but that didn't bother me either. I think the humor makes up for that.\n\nLynsay Sands is now one of my favorite authors for paranormal romance, up there with Molly Harper and Vicki Lewis Thompson, who also know how to inject laughable moments into a love story. If you like vampire romance that can be silly at times, and you haven't read the Argeneau series yet, I definitely recommend checking it out.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Not only that, they want to find their forever mate and fall in love.\n\nDr. Gregory Hewitt is a Psychologist and he just finished his day of work. Walking through the parking lot, he gets kidnapped and knocked out by a woman. He wakes up and finds himself tied to a bed. A strange woman tells him that he's a birthday gift to her daughter, Lissianna, and he decides that she's crazy. But once he sees Lissianna, he can't get her out of his mind.\n\nLissianna is a beautiful vampire who hasn't found Mr. Right in centuries. But, once she lays her eyes on Dr. Gregory Hewitt, there's just something there that she can't deny. Not only that, she hopes that he can help her with a particular... problem.

So imagine my surprise when I noticed this book as 'Book 1'.  I wasted no time downloading it, as I usually enjoy these books.\n\nAnd it wasn't as though I didn't enjoy this one--it was OK.  It just didn't compare with most of the ones that I've read.  As always, it was cute and entertaining.  The Romance was hot.  The Lifemate was found.  No cliffhanger ending.\n\nHowever--the 200 year old Vampire Heroine was way too stupid and naive to have survived that long, sorry.\n\n(Slight Spoilers follow)\nShe faints at the sight of blood.

They were the only fluid scenes in the book. Those were well written. Otherwise the plot was predictable and boring. The only surprises I had reading this book was the number of times Greg found himself tied to a bed or chained up.\nWhat I liked about the book:\n1) Its a vampire story, so Im always curious to see the culture an author creates for such creatures. What the author creates is very sci-fi and unique.\n2) Its a fantasy, vampire, romance novel. If you like a steamy romance scene, you can skip through the rest of the book and read just those parts. They are the only well thought out/ well written scenes in the book.\nWhat I didn't like:\n(Theres a lot I could digress and rant about, but I will focus on three main points.)\n1) Redundancy. A good one third of the book is repetition. The reader has an event with a bit of action. Then the reader has to plow through a long narrative exposition about said event, being told every little detail about why such and such is bad or good. And then the same event is told again in a clumsy dialog between the characters.\n2) Pointless characters. I like a book with a lot of characters, IF they are memorable and there is a point to them. There was no point to half the characters in this book. They were not memorable, they were not funny, and they did not add to the action or the drama. They were pointless. They went around dressing the same, talking the same, and behaving the same way.\n3) Dialog.

Greg was looking forward to his first vacation in years, but next thing he knows he's climbing into a stranger's trunk, then is tied to a bed. He's convinced that he's being gifted as a sex slave (which isn't so bad, really), while Lissi believes he's dinner. Actually, Lissi's mom chose Greg because he's a psychologist who specializes in phobias, and her daughter has a debilitating one. Lissi is hemaphobic, which is quite the problem when you're a vampire.\n\nI loved the way vampires were presented and explained in A Quick Bite. They're human, but not quite superhuman, and definitely not dead or undead. Vampires are a kind of new strain of human which came about kind of by accident. A combination of nanotechnology and bioengineering created a way for damaged tissue and other ailments to be reversed. The nanos ended up being able to multiply using blood, essentially allowing humans to remain in peek condition for centuries or millennia. None of the vampire myths are true, except that they must consume blood to keep the nanos replenished. I adored this scientific take on vampires, but I had to wonder how this technology came about if the origin of vampires is in ancient times? Specifically at Atlantis...\n\nOf course there's a romance between Greg and Lissi which I really enjoyed. There was a mutual attraction at first, but they did get to know each other while Greg was held hostage. Then some \"true mate\" stuff comes into play to speed things along, which is fine. But my favorite part was Lissi's family! Her birthday party is in full swing while Greg is tied up and he gets to meet everyone as the night went on, since they're all concerned about Lissi's phobia. It all made me smile and giggle, since it's clear how close the family is, and they've all got their quirks too. I'm definitely looking forward to getting to know them all better.\n\nA Quick Bite was a great introduction to the Argeneau series! It's very light and doesn't take itself too seriously. Some bits are kind of cheesy, but in a fun and silly way rather than eye-roll inducing. I do wish more time had been focused on Lissi's phobia, but our couple manages to get themselves in quite the predicament when someone stumbles upon Lissi's secret identity as a vampire.

You kidnap a psychologist that specialises in phobias, of course. Not only does Lissianna's mother Marguerite do that, she ties Dr Greg Hewitt to Lissianna's bed and wraps a red ribbon around his neck, because you know packaging is everything. Lissianna however thinks he is dinner and has a quick bite - hence the name of the book - before the family intervenes.\n\nI'm going to talk about the world building initially rather than the characters as I think the concept was pretty unique. Vampires actually originated from the technologically advanced, ancient Atlantis. They combined nanotechnology with bioengineering. These nanos which live inside their bodies require blood to keep the vampires in optimum condition. Vampires aren't allergic to the sun but it does mean the nanos have to work a bit harder to repair them and need more blood. It kept sparking memories of the epic science fiction show \"Red Dwarf\" which featured recalcitrant nanos.\n\nFearful of discovery, vampires no longer feed \"off the hoof\" but instead use blood banks to survive. Lissianna however is hemophobic which means she needs to either be fed blood intravenously or find victims she can feed off directly. Lissianna tries to combine her interest in social work with finding food and so works at a local shelter. She is affected by the blood she drinks so consuming the blood of a drunk or ill person affects her negatively. While the interactions between Lissianna and Greg were fun, they were not really deep and meaningful. I thought that Greg was far too calm and rational when he found out that vampires were real and got on the `vampires are cool' bandwagon way too fast. For a psychologist he is fairly shallow - when he's tied to a bed in a strange house with a bladder that is about to burst he thinks that it would be great to be a sex slave for someone like Lissianna. Come on. Despite this, I loved the fact that life mates were unable to read each other's minds or control each other. This offered the chance for a true partnership rather than having one dominate over the other.\n\nThe secondary characters, or should I say cast of thousands were really distracting. Even with the best will in the world, I couldn't differentiate between the HEA fodder. Introducing all of them at once seemed a bit of a clumsy move even though I can understand that some characters were needed to assure Greg that Lissianna was sweet and really needed his help. The interactions between the secondary characters lacked some maturity. A pyjama for people over the age of 200 just seemed bizarre and for no purpose other than to allow the females to strut around in their rainbow of baby-doll lingerie. The villain of the piece was no better constructed as he basically had a neon sign pointing to him, yet Lissianna and the others were completely flummoxed.\n\nThis book is fun even though plot is uncomplicated and the outcome predictable. It is light, cheesy and delicious in small quantities.", "Feedback": "positive"}

A blood phobia isn't the worst phobia you can have - it's not as if you have to see blood all the time, right? Well... Try telling that to Lissiana Argenau, a relatively young vampire whose phobia really puts a damper on her quality of life (she is neither dead nor undead, thank you). It would be so conveniant to be able to keep the fridge stocked with a few bags of blood instead of having to feed the old-fashioned way without spilling even a drop!\n\nWhen her mother hears about Dr. Gregory Hewitt, who specializes in treating phobias, she is delighted - what a perfect birthday present for Lissi! Maybe making an appointment would've been the reasonable approach, rather than tying the man to Lissiana's bed with a bow around his neck. That way, Lissi wouldn't have mistaken him for dinner. And Greg wouldn't have come to the conclusion that he was abducted to be her sex slave...\n\nPros:\n\nA vampire with a blood phobia is a charming idea. The story starts out with tongue-in-cheek humour and a light-hearted take on supernatural romance, and manages to weave that through the whole novel, beginning to end... But. See further down under \"Cons\"!\n\nI like that the author tries a fresh aproach to scientifically explain the existance of vampires - I just don't like the execution, which I will also talk about a bit further down. I do like that these vampires are still very much in touch with their human side, and that they live in families - there are no dark, brooding, tortued creatures of the night here, which is a nice change.\n\nLissi is a nice character, and so is Greg... In fact, all of the main characters are likable. Heck, I even sort of liked the \"villain\" (at least until he really lost it towards the end.)\n\nCons:\n\nThe language is a bit repetitive at times, and often, the author over-explains and over-describes. There were a few scenes that got a chuckle out of me, but in many situations, the humor felt forced and construed.\n\nSome of the characters lack depth. Maybe they will be developed more in the other books of the series, though?\n\nThe scientific explanation seems more than a little far-fetched to me. I don't want to give too much away, but there are a few details that just don't make much sense. (If you need more blood in your *veins*, then *drinking* blood isn't going to do you much good?) While I usually like it when an author doesn't simply say \"It's magic!\" and calls it a day, I'd prefer that to an explanation that I can't \"believe\" in.\n\nFor people who are supposed to be very intelligent, both Lissi and Greg are downright oblivious to what goes on around them and/or fail to draw the right conclusions to what they witness. I don't want to spoiler you too much, so here's just a small example:\n\nGreg is abducted by people who can obviously control his mind. When Lissi finds him tied to her bed, she thinks he's dinner. Her young cousins talk about drinking bagged blood in front of him. Lissi's mother looks as young as her daughter. Nobody seems to make much effort to hide what they are. And it doesn't occur to him at all that they might be vampires (or at least suffer from the delusion that they are) until he sees the bite marks on his neck?\n\nThe love story between Greg and Lissi is cute but a bit lackluster. From the first time they meet, it's clear that they are going to turn out to be soulmates eventually, but I didn't really feel the the spark. It had all the suspense of a cooking recipe: take one pretty vampire, add a hunky doctor, sprinkle some spicy misunderstandings on top and stir until you get a perfect couple.\n\nIt feels like there isn't enough plot there to fill a novel, so the author tacks on two threatening issues: a mysterious person who's out to harm Lissi, and an authoritarian vampire uncle who might have Greg's mind wiped. It's a classic pattern: person A and person B fall in love, but there is conflict C that stands between them and possible villain D that means them harm, so they need to come up with solution E to gain their happy end.\n\nBut it shouldn't be so bloody obvious! (Pun intended.) Don't get me started on the \"mysterious\" person! From the first time he is introduced, it is absolutely 100% crystal clear what's going to happen - and it's absolutely 100% unbelievable that Lissi doesn't even have a clue! Come on, she CAN'T be that dense? I literally groaned out loud when I realized that the book really *was* going to end the way I'd suspected all along; I'd hope that it was a red herring.\n\nSummary:\n\nI honestly wanted to like this novel because it seemed right up my ally: vampires, a love story, quirky humour and an unusual explanation. But the logical flaws and the utterly ridiculous obtuseness of the main characters sort of killed it for me.\n\nI'm still going to pick up the next novel, because I feel that the author has something here that *could* be really fun and entertaining, and I'm hoping that this novel just suffered from first-book-syndrome.", "Feedback": "negative"}

Brought to you by OBS reviewer Heidi\n\n*Beware of Spoilers*\n\nDr. Greg Hewitt is wrapping things up at work at his psychology practice on the last night before his first real vacation in years!  As he is thinking of sand and sun and the things he will enjoy during his trip to Cancun, he notices a woman getting on the elevator with him as he's leaving the office.  He was surprised when she gets off at the same garage level as he does, but wasn't that concerned about it.  But he can't understand what has come over him when he puts himself in the trunk of the woman's car, goes home with her, and then obediently goes upstairs lies on the bed and allows her to tie him to the bed.\n\nThe woman is Marguerite Ageneau, a vampire, who has decided to give Greg to her daughter, Lissianna, as a birthday gift.  Lissianna is a vampire that faints at the sight of blood and Greg specializes in curing phobias and Marguerite wants him to cure Lissianna so she can live a normal life and feed from bags of blood like most vampires instead of taking chances by feeding off live donors, which sometimes leads her to getting drunk or worse when she doesn't notice the condition of her dinner until it's too late.\n\nLissianna feels bad that Greg is being held against his will because of her.  So she and her cousins sneak Greg out of the house and take him home, but they forgot to erase his memories.  So Lissianna's mom and aunt go to take care of it, but are unable to wipe his memories and worse, he has figured out what they are.  So they take him back home with them and contact the council to determine what must be done.\n\nLissianna takes Greg on the run when she finds out that nobody can erase Greg's memories and she worries what that will mean for him.\n\nThis series came highly recommended to me, but after reading this saying I was underwhelmed is an understatement.  I think my big problem with the book is that it seems too unrealistic.  A guy gets kidnapped twice and he's cool with it.  He doesn't even mind missing out on his vacation that he's been planning for months, but instead spends a couple of days tied to a bed by a bunch of vampires.  The whole thing just doesn't play for me, no matter how hot Lissianna is.  And the romance in this book just didn't work for me; it felt too rushed and even at the end of the book they still felt like strangers instead of lovers let alone life mates.  Not to mention her phobia never gets cured.\n\nI also found the vampires' fangs were really strange in this book.  I'm used to them being used to puncture the humans' veins for them to feed, but in this book they seem more like straws.  When they drink bagged blood they put it on their teeth and suck it down.  I thought it was pretty weird myself.\n\nI saw the supposed plot twist about Father Joseph a mile away and figured he suspected Lissiana of being a vampire from the moment he offered her the garlic soup and didn't really feel the office full of crosses was necessary to drive the point home.  If Sands wanted this twist to be a surprise, she should have been more subtle.\n\nThis book was marketed as being funny, but I just didn't see it.  I think I laughed once.\n\n\"Still in Bed?\" Thomas had asked with amusement, as Lissianna had blinked at them. \"I am so glad you got at least a little rest today. I feared you'd work Greg to death while the rest of us tried to sleep.\"\n\nThe book did start getting better toward the end, but it just wasn't enough for me to truly like it.  Maybe the next book in the series will be better.  One hopes so anyway.\n\nThis review and more at openbooksociety dot com", "Feedback": "negative"}

A number of years ago, I couldn't even tell you how many, I somehow ended up with a book by Lynsay Sands, titled Tall, Dark & Hungry. I don't know how it came to be in my possession, but it became my favorite bathroom book. Yes, I read it while...well, you know. And it was entertaining.\nKnowing it was the fourth book in a series, I had always meant to read the others, but I just never got around to it. \"Readers woes.\" And then A Quick Bite, the first in the Argeneau Vampire series magically went on sale at B&N for $0.99. Romance and vampires....how's a girl supposed to resist?\nIt could be that I have developed more discerning tastes in the last few years...but I didn't find myself enjoying A Quick Bite as much as I did Tall, Dark & Hungry. The writing was fun, engaging and the characters all witty, so it's not that I didn't identify with them (okay, okay, \"identify\" is strong language for a vampire book, but you get what I'm saying!). I think it's just that I sometimes found the story SO ridiculous, that even as a fictional vampire book, it was too much for me to believe. Call it what you will.\nSome of my problems with the story lay with Greg, the kidnappee, becoming totally a-okay with being kidnapped. Hey, I don't care what the reasoning was, it just felt un-fricken-believable. Stockholm Syndrome much??? I also had a problem with the entire coven of vampires openly talking about their vampirism in front of Greg when he didn't even know about it...and then acting all shocked when he heard them. \"OMG, WE WERE TALKING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU HEARD US... NO WAY!\"  For vampires, some of them were just really fricken stupid. Come on, man.\nBut I think the thing that aggravated me the most was that I knew who the bad guy was, before there was even a bad guy. I hate when authors lead me around by the nose, like I won't be able to figure it out for myself...or even worse, like I don't like surprises. It also felt like the said bad guy was there as an after thought, just to move the story from point A to point B, with no true substance. Because sometimes he was there, and then he would be forgotten for large portions of the book.  Snooze.  I don't know, maybe there was some deeper meaning there and I just blindly missed it.\nBut you know what? Overall, I did enjoy reading the book. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it a lot. I sort of wish I hadn't even spent 99 cents on it, but it is what it is. There is definite sexual chemistry for all you smut lovers out there, but there isn't a ton of sex...this isn't Black Dagger Brotherhood, after all. But it's probably still up your alley. I did like the twist Sands puts on how the vampires came into existance in the first place.  Either it's been so long since I read the other book that I had forgotten, or it isn't mentioned in that one at all.  Either way, it was news to me, and pretty fascinating to boot.  I like when an author mixes a bit of cultural legend with fiction.  The writing was funny and engaging as well, and yes, it was meant to be a comedy, because it did get quite a few lulz out of me. But I can definitely tell there have been improvements between books 1 and 4. I might even still read the others....someday.", "Feedback": "negative"}

Lissianna, a vampire that faints at the sight of blood, gets a birthday present, a sexy psychiatrist who is tied to her bed. Hilarity and chaotic/exciting moments ensue...\n\nGenerally speaking it's a fun book to read if you're a fan of the vampire/supernatural genre. There are a few technical problems here and there but as long as you try not to take those things too seriously and you'll be fine.\n\nFor example, there are places where there exists large, multi-paragraph descriptions, devoted to the observation of a single thing. All the while, the characters do nothing but stare blankly at said thing.  To those of you who have watched the TV show \"The Wonder Years\", you know what I'm talking about. There were occasions when characters stared blankly at objects and said nothing. They just kept thinking their inner monologue. Personally, there were times I imagined how weird that looked, to stand in a room where two main characters just stare at each other for an extended length of time, and have nothing happen. Just looking... and looking... and looking... But, that's just me. You can skim those paragraphs if they get too long, and you'll still be ok.\n\nThis story works fine as a stand alone book. As someone who hasn't read any other books from the series, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything story wise. In some series' you would sometimes encounter unexplained characters, who would only make sense if you had read the other books. In this book though, I never felt like there were any obligatory cameos at all. The book's female protagonist did have a large family (The Argeneau Family), the members of which, I asume, are each the subject of their own books in the line. They all had different personalities, but since they had the same goal, in the end, memorizing every name and motivation wasn't an issue, so I never felt lost or confused.\n\nThere's a vampire hunter sub-plot. It was ok. It did what it had to, and didn't get in the way of the romance, the latter, of course, being the important bit.\n\nThere was one rather large large plot that never gets resolved at the end, which kind of bothered me. The author did that thing where the book simply goes: It will get resolved in the future, even though you don't read about it here, or anywhere else, it will get resolved, trust me. The end.\n\nThat being said, as long as you read this book as the tale of a kind hearted vampire with issues and a psychiatrist who finds himself falling for her, you'll be fine.

Sure there was some passion and danger, but there was also this light vibe and some humour.\n\nI liked the plot idea. Lissianna is an 200 year old vampire, she has no problem biting down on a neck but in these modern times most blood comes in bad. And Lissi has one big problem, she faints at teh sight of blood. Her mother kidnaps a hunky men and leaves him on her bed, the doctor to fix her problems. A sexy doctor that makes her long for a bit more.\n\nLissi was nice, and after delving deeper into her past I understand her fear of blood. Greg was understanding, well, after a while, and they seemed to good for each other. But being immortal is not that easy when it comes to men.\n\nAnd there I come into the best part of the book, the vampires. Not silly cross fearing, no shadows bloodsuckers here. No there is a good scientific reason; Atlantis, scientist, nanobots into bloodstreams to cure illness, and those same nanos were just too good. Which left the people almost immortal, but in a need of blood not to die. The same nanos can be transferred from mother to child, and if you find you perfect mate. There you got, vampires created by mistake by a superior people. I loved the originality of this.\n\nThe tone is light, and had me reading fast. One thing did bother me, a certain danger that emerged and that was so obvious but that Lissi did not see. But then she did have Mr Hunk on her mind so I forgive her.\n\nMy recommendation and final thoughts:\n\nI liked this book, and it is a series that I would recommend. There are still lots of single vamps that need to find true love, and I wonder what dangers might emerge. A 3,5 with a promise of more to come. I enjoyed this story, and I sure enjoyed the background for the story. It was a sweet story, throw in some passion and mix with one big nosy family.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2CCQ83OH7WGAE", "ProductID": "B000GCFWXW", "Review": "Good for a Laugh This paranormal romance is presented as a comedy, a much lighter take on 'the vampire genre' then many you will find. This alone makes it stand out from the crowd, but despite the unique angle, it is not extraordinary.\n\nThe Plot:\n\nLissianna is a vampire who happens to be afflicted with hemophobia (she faints at the sight of blood). Greg is a psychologist who specializes in phobias. Lissianna's mother kidnaps Greg and presents him to Lissianna as a birthday present in hopes that he will cure her phobia. She, however, mistakes him for a snack--and also finds herself desperately attracted to him. The feeling is evidently mutual, thus romance ensues.\n\nThe Best Thing About This Book:\n\nThere really are some laugh-out-loud moments, especially in the beginning. It's situational comedy at its best.\n\nThere are also some rather sweet moments between Greg and Lissianna. Sands does a fair job at establishing their feelings for one another, even in the midst of all the silliness.\n\nWhy it Lost Two Stars:\n\nDespite the fact that this book is entertaining at times, overall it falls into the category of average. The world that Sands presents is not very unique when compared to anything else in the paranormal or fantasy genres. As such, experienced readers may find it predictable and boring.\n\nThe characters are too many, and not all that well developed. We are presented with an entire cast of cousins, far to many to keep track of, and we really aren't told much about them to make them memorable. Even the main characters are undeveloped and somewhat unbelievable. I had particular trouble with Greg. I simply could not understand what motivated him throughout the story to stay with Lissianna, what kept him from being angry with her family, or why in the end he fell in love with her (the emotion is made plain, but not the rationale).\n\nThere were moments in the plot, even those more serious moments, when I simply felt that the book was way to silly. The antics of the book's villain, a priest with a drive to kill vampires, were ridiculous and not particularly funny.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, fun read. I advise that it is not meant to be taken seriously, and will likely not appeal to many of the more jaded paranormal romance readers.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

The entire thing took place in a matter of just a couple of days.  I had a hard time with that as it didn't seem like enough happened to really create a lasting bond between the hero/heroine.  It all happened too fast.\n\nThe characters themselves are immature and shallow.  Greg wasn't much of a hero to me.

They're all good reads, lots of fun (if a tiny bit predictable after the third or fourth one), and I'd call them delightful brain candy.  But one would think that an author characterized as a \"New York Times bestseller\" would rate a bit better editor and proofreader than these books rated.  In other words, there are errors that detract from the reading experience as far as I'm concerned.  Granted, I'm a bit of a \"grammar nazi,\" and I freely admit this.  But come on; with the price of books these days, do we as purchasers and readers not deserve better than to read offerings that include errors such as the use of \"past\" when the context indicates that \"passed\" is correct? (No, the two words are not interchangeable.)  Equally, the author's use of \"he and Joe\" in place of the correct \"him and Joe\" is disturbing.  Equally disconcerting are the number of comma errors throughout each of the books, print or electronic.  So read the books, enjoy the stories, but don't depend on them for improving your grammar.

They even refer to themselves that way.  There are no evil demons in possession in \"A Quick Bite\" but I found myself suprisingly drawn into the story of how Lissa, a 202 year old vamp, and Gregory a mid-thirties physchiatrist meet.  I found the vamp's family all to be intriguing and fairly fleshed out and I can see reading more books about them.  There are definately some aspects of the relationship that don't ring true, for example how quickly they fall in love.  Obviously, also, in real circumstances, if you were mind tricked, tied to a bed, and made 'dessert' for a vampire, you'd probably be freaked out and running away from, and not straight to, the vampire.  However, this isn't reality and that is what I like to escape from when I read.  I found this to be a fast, lightweight read that I enjoyed every minute of.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I am afraid I just have to voice my complaint very strongly about the way this series is being published.  This should have been the first story instead it comes after the others which are also not in order.  The entire series is being published backwards.  So how can I get interested in these vampires when the next book has a married brother unmarried and half the characters missing who were in the last story and someone is married who never had a story.  What sense does that make?  A primary reason for getting attached to a series is that the characters continue to grow not regress.  I can hardly make sense out of who is supposed to be mated and who is not.  What publisher would do such a thing and for what reason. Certainly not to get readers hooked.  Believe me it took me a while to realize what was wrong with the series and why it seemed so confusing to me.  If I were an author I would never let my work be published in that way.  Was Ms. Sands afraid to argue with her publisher for fear of being dumped. She should have held out for the correct order and thus make this series ten times more enjoyable and 100 time more addictive. I was so disgusted when I realized who the main characters were (they were already married in a previous book).  Do yourself a favor wait till this series is finished and then buy all the books and read them in order.

Lynsay is back with another long-awaited Argeneau tale, and new sexy updated cover instead of the cartoon ones.  New Publisher, the vamps are no longer with Dorchester.  They're now put out by Avon (though Dorchester will continue to do her Historicals).  Originally, this was the very first Argeneau tale in the series, not Single White Vampire (Lucern's tale).  So it's great to finally get Lucern's little sister's story.  As followers of the series know, the Argeneau vamps are the modern day, intelligent sort, who know feasting in the wild can get \"blood\" with all sorts of problems.  In order to skip all this rather mundane ugliness, they've invested in blood banks that see them supplied with a full range of \"flavors\" and blood that is safe!  Only, Lissianna really has trouble with this popping her fangs into a blood bag and having a quick munchie.\n\nSo Mama Argeneau sets out to give Lissianna the perfect present - one sexy male tied up and waiting.  Well, Lissianna wants Mr. Right, not just Mr. Available.  She's tired of her vamp immortal life, and would like someone to share it with.  Lissianna has other problems, such as her fainting at the sight of blood, an annoying trait for a vampire.  For a Birthday gift, Mama has gone out and fetched Dr. Gregory Hewitt, used mind control to get him to tuck himself up in the trunk of her car, and now has him tied up nekkid on Lissianna's bed.  Wouldst that all mums were so obliging on birthdays!\n\nGreg was planning a much-needed vacation.  The last he recalls is leaving the office and planning on getting away.  Instead, he wakes up in a stranger's bedroom.  Well, he's male - this cannot be all bad.  Okay, she's a vampire romance may be a bit difficult to work out, but to quote Joey Brown in Some Like it Home, \"nobody's perfect.\"\n\nA great tale which you can sink your fangs into!  Expect Vincent Argeneau sometime after the first of the year.  Keep 'em coming, Lynsay!\n\nFor thos paying attention - the series has NEVER been \"in order\"\nSingle White Vampire was Lucern's tale where wrote about his siblings' lovelifes - their real lovelife and romance editors thought they were vampire romances.  So the takes of his brothers and sisters come AFTER his tale meaning they had already happened before Lucern happened.  Since there are four more currently planned over the next two years waiting to read them in order is plain silly.\n\nThey are to be read and enjoyed.  Cannot do better than that.

When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.\n\nThe paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.\n\nThere are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.\n\nMy recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.\n\nThe NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

I've subscribed to the kindle NYT paper for exactly one year now, and I fully expect to subscribe to it on the kindle until something better comes along.\n\nA quick summary of what is to like about the kindle version would be: you don't have to throw away an entire tree with each delivery, you get it delivered to you rain or shine the same time each day, reading it at work doesn't attract as much attention as the paper version would, sunlight reading is no problem, reading while on the exercise cycle is no big deal, and there aren't all those annoying adds.  The negatives include the following: lack of graphics (I know, the tech doesn't support much yet), no colour (coming soon).\n\nOh yeah, and lest we forget, the paper delivery price, less the teaser discount, is 14.80 USD / week as I write this.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Easy to Read; Easy to Skim I live in Boston and had been waiting for the Boston Globe to become available for the Kindle since mine arrived on December 4, 2007. I subscribed the first day I found out about it and have not been disappointed. I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.\n\nEnter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess). Some pictures are now beginning to appear too. The ads are gone (so unless you only buy the paper for the ads - some people do - you will be pleased). The Contents, Sections and Next Article layout is great. From the main page you can just skim all the headlines by hitting the next page button until you get to the end - and then you'll know you haven't missed any of today's headlines. If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there). The only thing that's missing is the comics and the death notices but you can read those on-line at the comic sites in the first case and the Globe's site in the case of death notices - if you really, really want to.\n\nGood job.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The paper has gone downhill: the writing has suffered, analysis is almost gone, and the paper has become more and more biased.  While the navigation is good, the Kindle version frequently has typos, and it will refer you to the website Post for many interesting articles which are clipped short.  As I am a local, I expect the Post to also cover local news, but it is deficient in what it selects.  There are some major issues going on, but they prefer to go back to some crime that is unsolved and happened years ago rather than dig into current issues--it's probably cheaper.  The Post covers politics, but the reporting is typically he said, she said with little or no research or analysis, and the editorial and news selection slant is decidedly pro-illegal immigrant.  I am not a conservative, but I would like more balanced reporting regardless of what the editorial board has to say.  To be fair, the Post occasionally has a fact checker article that is useful. For the last several months, I've found myself skipping over the much of the paper.  Many of the writers have an annoying habit of launching into an article, but failing to give you the key information until the last couple of paragraphs.  I suppose that is to peak my interest or something, but it's like listening to Bolero.  I am in the process of cancelling the subscription.  By all means, try a free subscription though.

Let me start this review off by saying that no one, and I mean NO ONE can write for Boba Fett as well as Karen Traviss can.  When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!\n\n***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***\n\nI knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!\n\nThe visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.\n\nDuring the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!\n\nWhile fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.\n\n***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***\n\nThis book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.

{"ReviewerID": "A1ZPIYFT6VHWIF", "ProductID": "B000JMKNQ0", "Review": "Boba Fett at work Boba Fett: A Practical Man by Karen Traviss is a short story that gives the reader an excellent idea of the mindset of the famed bounty hunter. Fett is, of course, a familiar figure to all Star Wars fans, and it is interesting to read a story that concentrates primarily on him. Plus, Karen Traviss had been an excellent writer for Star Wars for quite some time until the two parties went their separate ways.\n\nThe plot of the story is based on a seemingly normal contract for a job that Boba Fett accepts with a mysterious client. Fett and his team are hired to start a small war. However, the war turns out to be the beginning of an invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong. Boba quickly realizes that they are supporting the wrong side, that success by the alien Yuuzhan Vong will probably mean the end of the Mandalorian culture and lots of other cultures.\n\nSo, the practical man is in a quandary. Does he honor the contract he agreed to or does he do what he can to subvert the efforts of the aliens? One further problem is that he may have to work with a Jedi agent if he decides to resist the invaders. The Yuuzhan Vong are an incredibly dangerous foe and make for some extremely entertaining reading.\n\nMs Traviss has always seemed to be fascinated with Mandalorians. Her books are riddled with their language, and she has delved into their culture at great length. On the other hand, she has not seemed to be a big fan of the Jedi. This story gives her an opportunity to branch out and basically just focus on Boba Fett.\n\nThis story was published as an e-book and may be readers' introduction to the Yuuzhon Vong or people may run across the aliens for the first time in Vector Prime. Either way works fine to give the reader exposure to some serious bad guys.\n\nBoba Fett: A Practical Man is an excellent story in the New Jedi Order and is well worth reading.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A3SZMGJMV0G16C", "ProductID": "B000JMKNQ0", "Review": "Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.\n\nSo it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.\n\nThis story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.\n\nDespite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.\n\nEven for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more, or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion. It's tough to be satisfied with this after reading Unifying Force, where Han sees Boba Fett fighting alongside Alliance troops.

{"ReviewerID": "A1J6B00Z1D6PS4", "ProductID": "B000JMKQKS", "Review": "Glycemic Load As Important As Glycemic Index Now that the media has jumped off the low-carb bandwagon and has resorted to bashing it to no end, they are desperately looking for another diet plan to embrace. What's interesting is that most of these \"new\" diet plans are nothing more than just an advanced look at the low-carb lifestyle.\n\nFrom the glycemic index to the glycemic load of foods, it can all be very confusing. That's where Dr. Rob Thompson's \"The Glycemic Load Diet\" book comes into play.\n\nDr. Thompson, a board-certified cardiologist for nearly three decades and author of \"The New Low Carb Way Of Life\", believes that too many of the diet books focus heavily on the glycemic index while all but ignoring the glycemic load.\n\nThe glycemic load does more than look at what is in the foods you eat, but also in the serving size that it comes in. As Dr. Thompson puts it, \"Low carb dieting suddenly becomes a pleasure\" when you take into account the glycemic load.\n\n\"The Glycemic Load Diet\" does something very important for any effective and permanent weight loss plan -- the book encourages exercise at least every other day that will not harm your body and will keep your insulin levels stablized and ultimately get you slim and trim. Too many other diet plans out there brag about not needing any exercise, but that is a sure-fire way to sabotage your weight loss plan.\n\nThe crux of \"The Glycemic Load Diet\" is around hormonal imbalance and how it causes people to crave foods they just don't need to eat. Dr. Thompson identifies what those \"toxic\" foods are that cause the cravings (HINT: sugar, white flour, starchy and processed foods -- sound familiar anyone?) and shows you how to eliminate those foods forever so the cravings go away.\n\n\"The Glycemic Load Diet\" is divided into three distinct parts focusing on various aspects of your plan for success: Understanding Insulin Resistance, The Glycemic Load Diet And The Slow-Twitch Muscle Activation Plan (very interesting concept!), and Proven Strategies To Balance Your Metabolism And Stay On Track.\n\nWhile what you read about in \"The Glycemic Load Diet\" is certainly friendly to people who are livin' la vida low-carb, Dr. Thompson believes the science behind insulin resistance has moved beyond what Dr. Robert C. Atkins has previously written about. That's why he believes people should pay attention to the glycemic load.\n\nDr. Thompson contends that people who reduce their glycemic load will not only lose weight, but will also lose their desire for starchy and sugary carbohydrates which cause spikes in your blood glucose and ultimately weight gain. However, he contends that \"sugar can be your ally\" in weight loss because it can stimulate your tastebuds. I don't think so! Sugar is very addictive and can lead some people who cannot control their urge to eat more and more of it to go overboard. With all due respect to Dr. Thompson, that part of his diet is not very wise.\n\nFinally, \"The Glycemic Load Diet\" discusses fat, cholesterol, and other factors in keeping your metabolism in check for permanent weight control. Of course, Dr. Thompson shares a few of his favorite recipes to get you off on the right foot to begin this new way of eating. There's even a glycemic load food chart in the back of the book so you can follow your progress in your lifestyle change.\n\nIn the end, Dr. Thompson says it may not be your fault if you are overweight because of your family history of insulin resistance. But he did say \"The Glycemic Load Diet\" is \"something you CAN do\" to change that now.\n\nIf you've tried every other low-carb diet plan and none of them made sense, then perhaps the glycemic load concept will be just what you need to lose weight and get healthy. I'm sure Dr. Thompson would agree with me that there is hope for you as long as you apply sound scientific research to your life. That's what \"The Glycemic Load Diet\" is all about.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A1P00M7SDR84JY", "ProductID": "B000JMKQKS", "Review": "not as much helpful information as i had hoped for When I found how much I gained form the Jason Fung information I decided that I should do some studying on other diet related theories that I had no knowledge of.  And as usual I went by the customer feedback on the amazon pages to quickly find the most valuable books to read on things like the paleo diet and the glycemic index stuff.\nWhen I put in the search terms 'glyceimc index'  for Amazon books I was a bit dismayed to have a page come up with a dozen or so paperbacks that had names and covers appearing to all be in a series done identically. When I clicked on titles, and went right to the customer reviews, it seemed that all the customers had the same feeling about the books, as if they were nearly identical.  A few people thought what they got was all they would ever need to know, and these must have been people who did not have much information about the subject.\nOthers like me, who left reviews, had information on the subject and wanted something more in depth. These comments were that the lists with glycemic loads of various food were all about packaged foods that they had stopped eating long ago, as I had, and not whole foods. I also noticed that the lists of foods all seemed to be identical from some government source.\nComments by people who felt a book lacked certain things led me along to other titles they said were better. So in time I did get to a book that had a bit more than the other did, 'Glycemic Load Diet' by Robb Thompson.\nAny book would give the basics, and the number of pages was also almost identical.  And the cover comments of how wonderful the book was, seemed to all be by authors of almost identical books. And each book seemed to have the last third be recipes.  Excuse me, but I have spices and ingredients thee authors never even heard of and cook healthy and very tasty meals  people are crazy for and I don't need a list of a dozen ingredients to measure and out in separate containers to mix in a special sequence. I grab stuff from where and there and put it all in one bowl, and if they had given me more glycemic numbers for real food it would have been a bit nicer for the diet thing, but otherwise still great.\nAnd I have news for all these authors ALMOST NO ONE BUT ME AND A FEW OF THE CUSTOMER REVIEWERS ACTUALLY COOKS WITH REAL FOOD ANYMORE.  Do they really think the fast food junkies in enough dietary trouble to buy their books is going to get all that stuff and measure it and make those time consuming dishes?  I don't think so.\nAnd some of the numbers I question because, for example I gave up 99% of wheat in my diet years ago. And years ago I found that pastas made from things that were not grains, were not exactly like wheat pastas, but were pretty good. And I also noticed that they did not make my blood sugar reading so drastic as anything wheat would do. I realized that the pasta from beans and roots and  pumpkin were what the glycemic index was all about. Only the lists showed they had the name number as wheat pasta. So it sort of missed what we were hoping to learn from the lists.\nI did get a number of important points out if the book. Fotr example, all the years of carb counting I read books that hinted alcohol did not have carbs as such, but anyone with sense would avoid it if all possible.  I believed that authors were just raining on the parade instead of saying 'GOOD NEWS, GET AS DRUNK AS YOU LIKE ON THIS DIET!!' the glycemic index I assume is the same in every book showed the same  < 'less than' sign it did for the meat and other protein foods as having no carbs to speak of . the text dais that alchhol could make you want to eat more, but that was all.  So let me give you the good news, you can get as drunk as you like on the diet!!  Now I don't drink often so when I do a very small amount works real good.  And given some very disturbing things happening at the time (what the I Ching calls 'misfortune from without', not something I caused to happen) and I was finding one a day of those little bud-a rama fake 8% margueritas for over a week  and binge watching historical costume Korean soap operas was making my life a lot less stressful.\nI did get a few things out of this book, but it does not rise far above the rest of the assembly line to serve a new audience. If there is an author out there who has some real in depth information and insight on glycemic index stuff, I, and at least several dozen others reviewing similar books did not find that person.\nWhile the glycemic diet is just another Atkin's  spin off, there are some things we did not know before that  that make it a bit easier to stay on, such as eating a bit of sweet at the end of the meal.  This I had already found helped to get my blood sugar to go down more after a meal.  I wish there had been more detail about that.  And since I did skip some parts perhaps there is.\nRight now I am an annoyed person and it is not easy to clear my mind to read books and put other thoughts aside. But then I think most people who are looking for a book of this kind are the same way.  And those of us who had to go total zero carbs for a couple weeks on Atkin's to get purple in the dig stick, may not do so well with the sweet at the end thing.\nBack wen we read Atkin's, we got some real info and most of us lost a lot of weight that stayed off for pretty long.  It remains to be seen whether there is any startling results to be happy about from dealing with the glycemic index.", "Feedback": "negative"}

To overcome hypoglycemia, you first have to learn whether you have underlying problems that Prof. Steven Rochlitz is uniquely renowned for uncovering at last.\n\nPorphyria is the major hidden problem causing hypoglycemia, Dr. Rochlitz reveals. Porphyria is NOT a rare disease. This metabolic disorder may affect 20% of us. Dr Rochlitzs first book on porphyria even includes blood sugar test guidelines for porphyria and reactive hypoglycemia.  The book also notes that blood sugar IV parameters for porphyria are similar to standard treatment for hypoglycemics.\n\nI can tell you for myself that hypoglycemia can result from porphyria and that dealing with the porphyria can finally yield stable blood sugars.\n\nThe book that saved my life and that finally led to my no longer having blood sugar crashes, is  PORPHYRIA: The Ultimate Cause of Common, Chronic, & Environmental Illnesses, With Breakthroughs in Diet, Supplements, and Energy Balancing, by Steven  Rochlitz, PhD.\n\nThe porphyria connection is also crucial because the hidden porphyric reacts to many drugs, and even to many supplements.

I was having problems sleeping one evening and happened to just grab this particular book from her to be read file figuring.  Why not?  (As if I do not have my own massive to be read mound of books stashed here and there all over the house...Duh to me).\n\nI must admit that I was upset at first due to the fact that I was absolutely clueless as to the plot line, characters and constant references to past events.  The next morning my wife informed me that this was one book in a series and that to really make sense of it I really needed to go back to the beginning, i.e. previous books in this series.\n\nThat is okay though, once I found this information I was able to kick in my imagination, overlook some holes in the plot and finished the novel in good shape.\n\nBasically this is a series about a group of women  The Sisterhood  who seek out revenge against those justly deserving punishment but who for some reason are untouchable by our legal system.  Yes folks, this is a vigilante revenge book as are the other in this series.  While most of the book is pretty mellow dealing with the love life of various members of The Sisterhood (or so it would seem) I must tell you that there is some EXTREME violence involved with these stories.  This group of women simply does not mess around in dealing out justice, no, no, no!  Good grief!\n\nIf you are the sort of person against, or are uncomfortable with good revenge stories, then you probably want to avoid this one.  If you are uncomfortable with graphic violence (I am talking torture her folks), you might want to avoid this one.\n\nThis sort of thing does not particularly bother me as long as animals are not involved and as a matter of fact I dearly love a good tale of revenge...I read The Count of Monte Cristo when I was very, very young and it is still a favorite of mine.\n\nThis particularly well written tale have our revenge seeking group going after and extreme wife beater and a husband and wife team who abuse horse.\n\nThe story is well written and I was able to enjoy it even though there were gapping holes in the story line and characters which I had to sort of read around.  This was not the authors fault...no it was mine.\n\nI think now I will go back and play catch-up and read the novels which came before this one.\n\nThis was a library find.

They seek out revenge on behalf of those that have been SERIOUSLY wronged from others. It's almost a female vigilante group. It can be mental, physical or emotional payback. This was pretty hard core. Wouldn't everyone just once in their life want to get back to someone if they could. This is a way we can pretend to just do that. Wonderful book and so fun to read.

I thought is was good but a bit far fetched with the plot.  I know the writer calls the shots as to where the story goes but I thought the logistic of this one was a little thin.  I can't imagine that such a high government official and a personal friend of the President would that easily gotten to.  The fact that he was a scum bag wife beater aside.

Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?\n\nFirst serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since. If you give this slim volume a chance (available for free in the Kindle format), you'll see why. Despite being a century old, The Diary of a Nobody remains quite amusing and is laugh-out-loud funny in parts -- particularly in sections dealing with tradesmen or with Lupin's impetuous business dealings or love affairs.

The stories themselves are mostly folk-tales (surprise!) although there are a few that a Western audience might consider to be fairy tales instead (most notably the first few, and a handful towards the end). There are nearly seventy tales in all (many very short), so you'll have to forgive me for not listing them.\n\nThe book is broken up by cultural group, with a brief explanation of each culture followed by a few stories. The stories tend toward the macabre at times, though overall they aren't any worse than Grimm's. You'd probably want to read over them before reading them to children, though. Just to make sure.\n\nThe language was good and the stories were good, but I have a few minor issues with the book.  First, the end-notes aren't linked.  They are marked, and if you'd like to slow your reading to a crawl you can use the search function to locate them, but they aren't active links, which can be frustrating. There's also no active Table of Contents, which I know bothers some people.\n\nSecond, there's a slight Euro-centrism to the stories. It wasn't really bludgeoningly obvious, but the cultures studied are referred to as 'primitive' and 'savage' at times, among other things.  This was a sign of the times (the book was written in 1916), but it's so foreign to the current way of thinking that it leaves a bad aftertaste.  This came out more in notes and informative-bits than in the stories, so it's just a minor concern if you're interested in the stories, but it is something to keep in mind.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Predominantly based on Thomas Malthus' principal that while population grows with food availability there exists a carrying capacity that will cause a natural check on man - much like war, natural disaster and pestilence already do in over-populated countries. The truest to London political views (5 stars).\n\n2. Small Boat Sailing - Espouses what a \"real\" sailor is and what he must endure in small crafts that are relentlessly beaten by the wind and sea. It takes a real strategician to command small vessels. A deep facet of London's growing-up (3 stars).\n\n3. Four Horses and A Sailor - London's rather tedious account of himself and four troublesome horses as he learns to drive them across California. Too many obscure details for a New Englander (2 stars).\n\n4. Nothing That Ever Came To Anything - A botched deal between London and a fellow that didn't deliver the goods but wanted a `gift' in return. London did the right thing (4 stars).\n\n5. That Dead Men Rise Up Never - An interesting ghost story in which the encounter takes place after one intensely disliked crewman is buried at sea after his death. The most macabre of the stories (5 stars).\n\n6. A Classic of The Sea - An ode to Richard Henry Dana, an expert of Maritime Law and an adventurer.

{"ReviewerID": "A2VKWLCNZF4ZVB", "ProductID": "B000MAHB4Q", "Review": "Love at first sight It was predicted that the Westmoreland children would all find love at first sight.  That is not going to be the case for avowed bachelor, Stone Westmoreland, in STONE COLD SURRENDER. In this fourth installment of the Westmoreland series, Stone is following in his Uncle Corey Westmoreland's footsteps--a bachelor to the end.  Uncle Corey has an entire mountain to himself and has declared it off limits to women.  Both men are affirmed bachelors until the Winters' women step into their lives.\n\nAfter a very sensual take-off from Atlanta to Montana, Madison Winters meets Stone. In a very short time, the two realize an instant attraction that simmers on the edge of each one's consciousness.  Madison, a schoolteacher from Boston, is on a mission to find her mom and bring her home or at the least find out what's gotten into her.  Abby Winters is acting in a fashion very uncharacteristic of a widow and mother in her daughter's eye, and it is especially worrisome because a man is involved.\n\nStone becomes completely enchanted with Madison, but he doesn't want to admit it.  He likes bachelorhood and doesn't want to make a serious commitment, or so he thinks.  When he realizes that Madison is somewhat inexperienced in the feelings of love and passion, he makes it his business to guide her through the discovery while helping her to locate her mother.  Once they find Abby, their perceptions about love and life may change considerably.\n\nSilhouette novels were always a favorite of mine in my youthful days, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why I gave them up, especially, after reading STONE COLD SURRENDER.  Brenda Jackson is a great romance writer.  Montana is not the most romantic place that I can think of, but add a couple of sensual individuals and Ms. Jackson's writing abilities and you have a wonderful and heartwarming love story that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling all over.  I feel like a kid in a candy store having just discovered a new flavor.\n\nReviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon\n\nof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers", "Feedback": "positive"}

Evangeline Anderson uses her excellent creative imagination in three well-written erotic paranormal novellas full of sensual pleasure.\n\nThe Girl, The Geek and the Time Machine is one of those stories that proves the saying \"You can't judge a book by its cover\" is true, when Dr. Ethan Robinson uses his time machine to help co-worker Kara at Smthye Labs, go back and restart a horribly bad day in her busy, hectic life. Kara, beautiful and always trying to please, especially her fiance Brad, has tried everything, including Holistic Healing Therapy to make herself perfect for Brad. When Ethan and Kara enter his time machine, without their clothes, they come to realize their attraction is more than physical. This was one of those enjoyable stories that had me thinking of the country song Somebody...somebody in the next car, somebody on the next train, somebody in the coffee shop you walk by everyday, somebody you look at but never really see...somewhere out there...is somebody. And in this story...out there somewhere in that time machine Kara finds somebody!\n\nIn Mirror of the Heart, Taylor Reeves meets the handsome and sexy futuristic cop Reese, when she is transported into the future and cloned to be a high priced courtesan in a futuristic agency that specializes in secondary clones. There is mystery and intrigue, from the beginning in present day Tampa to way into the late two thousands. Reese stuggles with his need for justice and vengeance against his enemies who just happen to be those who run this cloning agency and his deep desire that is growing for Taylor. How can he avoid wanting her, pleasuring her to keep her out of danger, at the same time not feeling as if he is using her as the agency plans, while also desiring a future with her? This sensual story is face paced and keeps the reader riveted to the pages.\n\nIn the hot and steamy Wild-Men and Wormholes, the beautiful futuristic archelogist, anthopologist and scientist, Ariel Stone-Tarrington travels through space to find unknown cultures, only to come across the handsome and sexy Kor. Lust turns to love. Will Ariel be able to save Kor and his people from her colleagues and becoming some scientific experiment in order to save their love?\n\nReaders who enjoy the futuristic, time-travel paranormals will love this book!

Evangeline Anderson has a superb immagination to fit the bill and fans will be looking forward to more and more futuristic paranormal romances with the added pleasure of erotica for that little extra spice!", "Feedback": "positive"}

However, a bigger problem with the paper is its size and cost.\n\nIn my youth, I used to read about half of the week day edition in about four or five hours. (I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.\n\nIn addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.\n\nSo the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.  (I'd include the address here, but Amazon blocked it so go to my profile for the list.)\n\nThe Latest News blog is a blog which is updated several times a day with the latest articles from the Times. Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.\n\nUnlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.\n\nThere are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.\n\nSecond is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs. If you see an article you want to read later, TURN OFF YOUR WIRELESS until you've read the article. Otherwise you may loose the article with the next update.\n\nI have also occassionally lost sync with Amazon's servers. If your subscription doesn't update, just restart your Kindle. It will take a minute or so, but it gives your subscription a kick in the pants and starts updating again.\n\nI've been looking for a current news blog. Now I've found it.", "Feedback": "positive"}

As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...\n\nRobert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.\n\nLady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.\n\nEach night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.\n\nFortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?\n\nEmma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.\n\nARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here: all 4 novels and all 56 short stories. The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus (though it appears twice in this ebook version, once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam). This ebook edition is very well-formatted, comfortable to read, has an active TOC (in which the books are presented in proper order), and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in \"The Dancing Men,\" unlike many other versions which substitute the word \"graphics\" for the drawings. Though there are no illustrations (such as some include from the \"Strand Magazine,\" in which most of these stories originally appeared), this is, nonetheless,  undoubtedly one of (if not THE) very best Sherlock Holmes collections currently available in the Kindle Store. (FYI: The non-Holmes set of 10 \"Tales of Mystery and Terror\" is sometimes added to other sets -- especially incomplete ones -- to boost their total story count, but this is easily obtained in the Kindle Store as a public domain freebie.) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries, this is THE ebook edition to purchase--and paying only $1.99 for Bantam editorial oversight and formatting quality (rather than going with some cheaper but incomplete, unauthorized, no-name, ebook bundler) makes sense.\nCAUTION: Be sure to get the $1.99 edition containing BOTH volumes 1 and 2. For some odd reason, the two volumes are also being sold separately, each at a price ridiculously higher than this combined edition.\n\nADDENDUM: Since the above was written other truly complete sets have appeared that you may wish to consider and compare to this one. Any truly complete set must have 9 books consisting of:\n4 novels-\n1-A STUDY IN SCARLET\n2-THE SIGN OF FOUR\n3-THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES\n4-THE VALLEY OF FEAR\nAnd 56 short stories in 5 books-\n1-THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES\n2-THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES\n3-THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES\n4-HIS LAST BOW\n5-THE CASE-BOOK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES\nBe careful with that last title; some will list it but only provide 2 stories from it.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Have seen it evolve over that time, and generally speaking it's been for the better... not perfect, but I do like it for it's often-random yet usually informative content.\n\nThe range of articles is wide, much like thumbing through a magazine or Sunday newspaper supplement, with something there for just about anyone. It's not a Kindle blog; it's more widely-spaced covering not just books, music and such. Some of the more-recent topics were:\n\n* Jim Henson's Lost Project Found in the New Year, by Alex Carr\n\n* Author Spotlight: Antoine Wilson on \"The Interloper\" (from the Kindle Editors)\n\n* Nifty Tips from the Los Angeles Times Food Section, by Melissa Trainer\n\n* The Original Mach 5 from Speed Racer: Mach GoGoGo, by That Car Guy\n\n* The 69th Golden Globes - What Went Down, by the Editors\n\n* Total Reader Immersion: Writing Evocative Descriptions, by Susan J. Morris\n\nAnd then there was the one that really caught my eye: an offer to enter the \"Amazon.com Books $1000 Gift Card Sweepstakes\" where one could visit the Amazon Facebook page for a chance to win. This one explained that they would randomly select one lucky winner on or about January 24th, 2012.  As one might guess, this Amazon Daily reader jumped on that one. Had this reader not seen that item on the Amazon Daily blog, it might have been missed, so it's a good thing to have been a subscriber.\n\nBut be aware that if you're trying to subscribe via your iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, computer or such, it won't work.

This is a paid subscription (under a buck a month) and one that has proven to be an invaluable resource to those who peruse the titles of the free book offerings. And don't let anyone kid you, the freebies here will often surprise you with their quality of content.\n\nBack to the Amazon Daily blog: it comments on the cool and catchy, the minor and marvelous, and features the best from the retailer, and it's updated wirelessly throughout the day.  From the weekend meal to the latest in hi-tech toys, this daily blog covers the offerings from Amazon.com's colossal catalog of items, books, gadgets, food and more.  It can be quirky and eclectic, and the subjects cover a wide range of topics.  If you're interested only in music, only in Kindle offerings, only in films and videos, only in the latest in best-selling books, then there will be quite a lot to plow through. But if your interests are diverse, you'll want to get this one so that you can read it at your leisure.\n\nAnd it costs all of $0.00, a real Kindle freebie.

On the other hand, there seems to be a lot of articles about cooking and fashion.  Not my taste, but I'm sure that someone else would really go for it.\n\nThere are many articles posted a day, and 20 available at any time.  Right now (January 13), there are articles saved back to January 11, so there's a high article turnover.  You probably need to read the blog at least every other day.\n\nWhat's wrong with the blog (other than the subject)? I have two major concerns.  Several articles have been just links to an online video.  As you know, Kindles don't display videos.  So those articles are just a waste of space.\n\nIn addition, there have been several articles which are really just calls for comments.  Again, that is a functionality that doesn't work on a Kindle.  You can neither leave a comment on a Kindle blog, nor can you read someone else's previous comment.  These aren't killer problems, but it does lower the utility of the blog.\n\nHowever, as I said earlier, I get enough pleasure out of the blog to keep subscribing to it.

Instantly attracted to and promising to be a good wife, particularly in the bedroom, Jessaline has no idea how much Llewellyn will come to mean to her, especially when their marriage is threatened by outside forces.\n\nLlewellyn Dunmore has spent his life watching his father go from woman to woman.  He knows no different and so he puts his knowledge to use by seducing anything in skirts.  He is happy and content to love women and leave them until he comes face to face with a red haired beauty vowing she would rather marry a Dunmore than the man handpicked by her father.  Vowing to not disappoint the lady, Llew marries her, but not before exacting a promise from her giving him full control of their nocturnal activities.  Llewellyn has no idea that he has just found the one woman to sooth the demon.\n\nLord Demon's Delight was in essence a delight to read.  I loved the premise and especially how the two characters met.

Jessaline lives like a prisoner in her home, and is beaten or whipped at any display of defiance.  In a final display of his control of Jessaline, Lord Nolan has arranged her marriage to the bastard son of a Catholic Bishop.  However much Jessaline may want to leave her father's home, her betrothed is not a better option.  He has shown himself to be equally as cruel as Lord Nolan and he will be able to hurt her in more ways than beating.\n\nJessaline refuses to marry Timon, and swears that she will marry a Demon of Dunmore before becoming Timon's wife.  As it happens, Lord Llewellyn Dunmore himself is witness to her vow and decides to hold her to it.  Jess is immediately attracted to Llew, but his reputation as a demon doesn't make him a much better alternative than her betrothed.  She agrees to marry him only after he promises never to beat her or physically harm her.  That alone makes him her best option.\n\nLlew comes from a long line of bastards.  For many generations, the men in his family have refused to marry, even though they have fathered many sons.  Rather than take a wife, these men have always chosen a life of drinking and whoring instead.  Llew is the first man in his family to wed, and now he is saddled with a complete stranger who isn't even his type.  In spite of the many reasons he should not be with Jess, he finds himself uncontrollably attracted to her.  Will the attraction between Jess and Llew grow into a real and lasting love?\n\nWhile Jess's father and fiance scheme to steal her back by any means necessary, there are magical beings from the fairy relm working behind the scenes to protect the couple.  The fairy are not known to the humans, but their influence cannot be denied.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this book is not for the prudish reader.  The sex scenes are frequent and highly detailed.  However, the sexual encounters occur only within monogamous, consenting relationships.  These scenes are not one-dimensional; they are intertwined with romance, passion, and love.  If I'm going to really enjoy an erotic novel, these are key points for me.\n\nSomething else that is crucial to me in an erotic novel is that the story and characters are of the same quality that I would expect in any other novel.  This book met all of my expectations in that regard.  Jessaline's character is smart, brave, and determined.  Llew is a sexy bad boy who is being transformed by his love for his wife.  Reformed bad boys are my favorite heroes in love stories, and Llew was no exception.\n\nThe only part of the story that I thought was a little weak was the ending.  It wraps up really quickly and there is no epilogue, so I finished the book feeling like I got robbed of my happily ever after.  I also wished for a little injection of humor in parts of the story, particularly from Llew's two brothers.  Lastly, even though the fairy involvement is scattered throughout the story, I would have loved to read more about these characters and their world.\n\nRecommended for fans of historical and/or paranormal erotica.", "Feedback": "positive"}

There are three \"fates\" who serve to match the main characters and make them fall in love (they seem to be serving the needs of the heroine, but this is never explained) and also intervene at a critical point to ensure the HEA.  These are the only paranormal elements and they really struck me as lazy storytelling - they just make it so the author doesn't have to explain why a confirmed bachelor would suddenly marry a woman he's never met before (and one who is the opposite of his physical type) and ensure that the heroine is rescued.\n\nMaybe you like unexplained love at first sight romances.  I don't, so be aware that is what you're getting.  He loves her at first sight and he finds they're good in bed together and she cleans up his house so he decides to keep her around.\n\nAlthough the initial setup of the book may make you think this is a historical romance, it is not.  The world is generic king and castle fantasy, but there isn't any realism or research.  It's maybe England, but witches were burnt at the stake at some point (witches were hung in England and England's witch craze happened AFTER the vagueish time period of this book).  There are open lesbians (who have threeways with the queen).  Illegitimate children can somehow inherit their father's title and property.  The setting was pretty much whatever the author wanted it to be.\n\nThe sex scenes were good, but I found myself so frustrated by the lazy storytelling and vague details that I didn't much enjoy this overall.  The author was also kind of fixated on testicles.  The hero's are \"set aflame\" when he sees the heroine (I asked my husband about this and he said he's never noticed anything like that happening when he sees a pretty girl).  When he notices she has nice teeth, he wondered what they would feel like biting him there.  At one point, he's thinking about her, trips, and hurts himself there.

There are no Demons of any sort in the book. It was still a very good read. The book also contains graphic sexual acts and language\n\nLady Jessaline Nolan against her father's wishes did not want to marry Timon, who the father has arranged for her to marry. The day of her marriage Jess yells to her mother that she would rather marry a Demon of Dunmore than the man her father has chosen. Lord Llewelyn hears her out burst and comes to her rescue by marrying Jessaline in exchange for any and all sexual things he wants from her, on the spot Jess agrees. ( sounds degrading, but it's not). While Jess and Llewelyn is off to his castle Jess's father tries everything to get his daughter back. Jess doesn't want to go back because her father abuses her and this is the course of action she must take.\n\nI loved this story. There is one thing I love more than a free book and it's a free book that's good. What I really liked about this book is the story started right away, no unnecessary intro and no unnecessary words. Even though it dived right into the story, you still understood what's taking place.  Through out the book we got to know Jess and Llewelyn and it was good reading their chemistry as the story plays out. It wasn't just the sexual things they did but it was the book as a whole that was pleasing to read. We got to meet the brothers, Allard and Graham whose stories will be coming out next as this is book 1. The brothers surely had me entertain as well in the book.

That is about to end as he and the rest of the group have been called into meeting in New York City.  Tony knows that Charlotte is efficient and calm in all circumstances; he also knows that she can be ruthless and guesses that she is a matronly lady.\n\nCharlotte Rhames is the executive assistant to the Devlin Group, a job she loves and is respected at.  She knows most people take her for only how she appears: rich and beautiful.  Charlotte can't wait to meet Tony. She knows everything about him, but has never actually met the man.  Charlotte has many expectations for their meeting, which she is hoping, ends in her home.\n\nTony is stunned when he actually discovers the person behind the voice is the young and sexy woman who came to pick him up.  This shock is just the beginning of the events that will put the entire Devlin Group on high alert.  When the group is attacked, they discover it was an inside job.  Charlotte knows she is the only one who can get to the person behind the attack, but it will mean going back into a world she swore never to visit again.  Tony won't let Charlotte go into danger alone, but when things go horribly wrong, both of them have to depend on the voices and abilities of the people on the other end of the links.\n\nOn the Edge brings back the characters from the Devlin Group and this time is Charlotte's turn to get her happy ever after.  But when you are a member of this group, nothing is ever easy and that includes love.  Tony has been put down most of his life because of his background - the same one that makes him perfect in his undercover work.  Charlotte has worked hard over the years to remove herself from her past and now she must face it again to save the others.  Danger feeds passion, and Tony and Charlotte already had the flames rising even before the danger happened.  I was never happier than when Tony and Charlotte made it out okay only to have them tear each other apart.  It made me want to knock their heads together, but I was rewarded in the end with a perfect ending.  Suspense stories have always been able to hold me in their grip. Ms. Stacey did one even better and wouldn't let me put the book down until the last word had been read.  On the Edge is sexy, full of danger, and has two main characters I just had to back.

Running from her ex has her moving from place to place after several months but for the first time she is unable to remain detached from the people around her.  To complicate matters even further, she's falling for her boss and has witnessed his death in a clairvoyant vision.\n\nEx-Special Forces operative and owner of Turner Industries, Kyle Turner III, knows everything there is to know about Aislinn.  He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.\n\nKyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.  Kyle's positive he can protect her  . . .  all he has to do is prove it to her.  Simple right?  Well, maybe not quite as simple as you'd think.\n\nAnnmarie McKenna's TWO SIGHTED will delight readers with the fun array of characters, witty conversations, sexual innuendos, and enough suspense to keep you riveted to the pages.  I loved the intensity of the relationship between Kyle and Aislinn.  And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end. Fortunately, Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina, Jon and JT's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.\n\nChrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)", "Feedback": "positive"}

But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!\n\nKyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...\n\nI do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.

Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.\n\nAislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.\n\nI was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Blackmailed/dp/1599982137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blackmailed</a>, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.

There was some heat to it, and some of it was written pretty well, so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise.

{"ReviewerID": "A2AHK99XS1URDD", "ProductID": "B000SWV6HG", "Review": "If Only... This romance book bundles the stories of heroes Sawyer, Morgan, Gabe and Jordan, 4 brothers who live together in their childhood home. Sawyer is the doctor, Morgan is the sheriff, Gabe is the laid back handyman and Jordan is the vet. Each man is in some way the pillar of their small town community, and other than being womanizers (in a nice and respectful way), they are all perfect. For that I gave a 1 star deduction. One decent, halo-over-his-head glowing, handsome, tall, muscular, sexy, honest, single, well-endowed, straight brother is amazing, two is shocking, three is a stretch, and four is defying the laws of possibility.\n\nOther than that each story was funny, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nSawyer is a divorced, single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls. He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence. Turns out she's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who's out to get her. Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.\n\nMorgan is single, large and a temper to match. At least he only pretends to have a temper. His bark is worse than his bite, but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior. Misty, Honey's sister, enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding. Morgan takes an instant dislike to her, a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her. He thinks she's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble. What's more, Misty is broke, unemployed, and pregnant. Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss, then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy. After learning of her situation, Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.\n\nGabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.\n\nJordan is the vet with the golden voice. Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother. Burnt badly by her ex-husband, she doesn't trust men and doesn't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others. Especially Jordan, who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand. Of all the books, this one is the funniest. Jordan's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless. However, of all the books, this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters. Between the romance brewing between Georgia's mother and Misty & Honey's father, and Sawyer's son, I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.\n\nWhat I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.\n\nLikable characters and cute stories.

{"ReviewerID": "A1DX8P31MBC2PE", "ProductID": "B000SWV6HG", "Review": "Started rocky, ended great I was so excited to read the series of the Buckhorn brothers after seeing what great reviews it got and since I liked one of Foster's other books I bought the bundle.\n\nThe first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.\n\nThe second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.\n\nGabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.\n\nJordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.\n\nCasey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.\n\nOverall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.  But in the end, you can't help but fall in love with each of them.", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2E9HDZXQORZLA", "ProductID": "B000UHAFGM", "Review": "Humor But Little 'Contemporary' Romance Contained in this Jennifer Cruise bundle:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Getting-Rid-Of-Bradley/dp/0373773234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Getting Rid Of Bradley</a>&nbsp;- 1.5 Stars\nLucy Savage just got divorced. Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.\n\nAcross the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.\n\nLucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.\n\nToday Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.\n\nWhat started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.\n\nThough I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.\n\nWhat really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.\n\nUnfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Strange-Bedpersons/dp/B002WEPC3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Strange Bedpersons</a>&nbsp;- 3 Stars\nOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.\n\nNick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.\n\nStrange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/What-the-Lady-Wants/dp/B002WEPEOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What the Lady Wants</a>&nbsp;- 4 Stars\nMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.\n\nTwelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.\n\nSHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him. Not for kicks, but to get help finding answers following the death of her uncle. Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.\n\nMitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.\n\nWith a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.\n\nMitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.\n\nCrusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Charlie-All-Night/dp/B000UH5Z2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Charlie All Night</a>&nbsp;- 3.5 Stars\nWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.\n\nPutting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.\n\nCharlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.\n\nHis position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.\n\nWhile the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.\n\nSo long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.\n\nOriginally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

The first chapter or so was funny enough and an interesting plot so that I bought the full book. Certainly could not read it right through, but when I finished the first one, it was enjoyable enough. I read a couple other books, then went back and read the next, and so forth.\n\nShe is funny and writes very well, and had clever plots, but the formula was far too predictable to make me want to read any more.\n\nThe last book got very tiresome with the two lead characters having sex, fighting, having more sex on and on and on, without the plot developing very much at all. And, I was fascinated at how many of the characters kept \"snorting\" every time somebody made a funny crack. It began to seem like a large pig farm.\n\nAnyhow, amusing books but you have to be an aficionado to keep reading her stuff. I guess I ain't one. Snort.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

This is the first 3 of 5 books in the series and spans a far number of years, bookending the Civil War.  Ms. Wiggs provides enough historical reference for the reader to understand the era, but gives you 3 very different settings: Boston/Ship/Rio, desolate island/Virgina horse farm, Georgetown.  The first starts out with the theme of the \"Ugly Duckling\" that is very pervasive through the 3 books.

{"ReviewerID": "A23ZNGL704AW7O", "ProductID": "B000UMZMLA", "Review": "5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques *NOTE*  These stories were originally released in individual, yet connected, ebooks.  The reviews below were written for the ebooks, hence the references to the print release at the end of each.*\n\n~Watch Me by Shelley Bradley~\n\nBallroom Dancing is Shanna's life.  She will do anything to win the coveted championship - something that has so far eluded her.  To that end, she has gone through so many partners she has been nicknamed the Bitch of the Ballroom.  But the competitive gene runs strong in Shanna's family, and she is the only one that hasn't yet proved her skill with a trophy.  She has given up everything for that goal, even to the exclusion of friendships or romance.\n\nThe moment Alejandro lays eyes on the beautiful dancer, he aims to change all of that.  Determined to win her affection, he tries unsuccessfully to woo her, even purchasing all of her dances at a charity event.\n\nBut a blackmail scheme and a career-damaging sex tape place Shanna right where Alejandro wants her - in his very own club, Sneak Peek.  In this playground for the sexually adventurous, Shanna sets out to trap a blackmailer even while Alejandro sets out to trap Shanna in his own web.  He recognizes the exhibitionist tendencies she harbors and knows just how to reach this woman's deepest desires now that she is in his lair...  Through it all, he will show Shanna that life is about more than just winning, and that love is the dearest prize of all.\n\nIf you have read many of my previous reviews, you have probably figured out already that Shelley Bradley, aka Shayla Black, is one of my very favorite authors.  Well, there is good reason for that - her writing absolutely rocks!  There seems to be no end to the worlds this author can dream up or the characters that speak to her.  She can write sweet, she can write spicy, and she usually combines the two in a way that stirs both the loins and the heart with equal fervor.\n\nWith the current popularity of ABC's `Dancing With the Stars' show, Watch Me's setting in the midst of a professional Ballroom Dancing competition is as topical as it is romantic.  While Alejandro may not be a professional dancer, he more than has what it takes to sweep Shanna off of her feet - a fact guaranteed to send the dancer with single-minded focus running in the opposite direction.  But in the true style of the best romantic heroes, Alejandro does not let this dissuade him from the prize.  He sees more in Shanna than the bitch she is purported her to be - he sees a woman afraid to love, a woman who has forgotten what living is all about, and he is determined to show her personally.\n\nShanna is a woman so focused on her goals, that she has left her life and even her very womanhood behind.  With her career firmly in first place, all else takes a backseat, including romance, friendship and even just plain old fun.  When she meets Alejandro, she knows to the depths of her soul he will be a distraction she can't afford, and fights her attraction to him with everything she has.\n\nWatch Me is a wonderfully hot little romance story with a resounding moral lesson.  Readers are reminded alongside Shanna that love and loyalty are the most important prizes of all, and to always keep your mind and your heart open.\n\nWatch Me is connected to Jaci Burton's upcoming release, Show Me.  The stories will be enhanced if you read them in order (Watch Me first and Show Me second) but each works very well as a standalone tale.  Both stories release separately in eBook this month from Samhain Publishing, and will be released together in print in an anthology titled Sneak Peek in 2008.\n\n~Show Me by Jaci Burton~\n\nAs heir to her father's holdings, and chairperson of her family's charitable foundations, Janine esteems reputation above all else.  No matter what her innermost desires are, as a member of the public eye, she must always be above reproach lest she besmirch the Bartolino name and damage their organization.\n\nWhen her friends drag her out for her thirtieth birthday, she has no idea they are going to Sneak Peek, an exclusive sex club.  And she certainly wasn't prepared to meet a man like Del, who seems to see inside her darkest fantasies, but has no regard for reputation, at least not his own.  But once she has a taste of what Del offers, she can't stay away, and soon she finds herself exploring the boundaries of exhibitionism with Del in ways she never before imagined.\n\nDel has always had his choice of women.  As the bachelor partner in Sneak Peek, he finds himself with more than ample opportunity to indulge his most hedonistic tendencies without reservation.  Yet when he meets the reserved Janine, he is intrigued by releasing her from her inhibitions and unlocking the passions she has buried deep down inside...\n\nJaci Burton has swiftly moved up my list of favorite authors, and when I learned she was partnering with Shelley Bradley to write the Sneak Peek stories, I jumped at the chance to review these stories by two such talented writers.  Burton's Show Me picks up where Bradley's Watch Me leaves off, and stars the supporting male character from the prior story, Phillipe \"Del\" Delacroix as well as seeing a return of Alejandro in a supporting role this time.  Bradley and Burton work well together, connecting the two stories seamlessly.\n\nDel is the epitome of the playboy/bad boy.  Rich, successful, and with some very wild sexual predilections, he is the kind of man women love to try and tame - just a little bit.  Getting to know his character, I found myself reminded of that line in one of Tim McGraw's songs more than once: \"I may be a real bad boy, but baby, I'm a real good man.\"  That describes Del perfectly.  Del is wicked, tempting, and absolutely untamable, but when it comes down to it, he is definitely a good man.  He shows his concern for Janine in everything he does, and still manages to push her limits sexually, fulfilling her wildest yearnings over and over again.\n\nJanine is a woman caught between the woman she thinks she needs to be and the woman she really is.  When her real world and her fantasies collide, she has to learn more than just how to let herself go - she has to learn to trust.\n\nI won't be shy about saying it - I loved this story!  Jaci Burton has penned a tale that is smoking hot, and also manages to be extremely romantic.  I felt every emotion these characters felt, and was on the edge of my seat until I finished the last chapter.\n\nShow Me is connected to Shelley Bradley's book, Watch Me.  The stories will be enhanced if you read them in order (Watch Me first and Show Me second) but each works very well as a standalone tale.

She just happens to fantasize about being watched while she has hot monkey love. On her thirtieth birthday, her best friends take her to a voyeur/exhibitionist club. I loved her honest reaction. She didn't hem and haw and then get dragged into the action.\n\nShe fled.\n\nI'm with Janine. She is a girl whose face is regularly in the society page. She is the CEO of her family's foundation. Marring her image will destroy the foundation's as well. A thirty-year-old executive should know better than to jump into a potential PR nightmare.\n\nAnd she does.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the reality of the character's attitude. It is a concern for people, maybe of all walks of life, but especially those who frequent the society pages, to worry about their sexual proclivities becoming public knowledge and damaging their career. That concern does impede the involvement of many who would otherwise participate.\n\nMaking the choice to participate would be slow and full of trepidation. It would have to have some intensely satisfying moments that made it irresistible when your sense of dread reared its ugly head. Janine walked through all of that with the help of Del.\n\nDel owns the sex club Janine visits, but to her surprise she learns that he is also the CEO of Delacroix Motors, and faces the same concerns and judgments she must endure. He is respectful and caring and knows how to draw out her inner sex kitten in a safe and satisfying way. Del does grow a little on his own, but it isn't well developed. We don't climb into his skin and feel the changes happening as we do with Janine. This journey is definitely more about Janine than Del and their happily ever after.\n\nSHOW ME is an erotic novella about the journey into the exhibition lifestyle. Outside of the voyeur/exhibitionism, the sex is pretty vanilla and tame (although absolutely satisfying!). Jaci Burton is always going to deliver plenty of steam, with this one you also get a great personal journey. Enjoy!", "Feedback": "positive"}

Personally, I am very annoyed by footnotes because they interrupt the flow of the story and lead me off on a tangent and then I have to find my way back and remember what was going on before this whole journey began.  This book is FULL of footnotes at the beginning and that just spoiled my attitude for the whole thing.  Once I passed the halfway mark, things were beginning to look up because the use of footnotes went down and the story started to bring itself together.  The characters themselves are very interesting and it'll probably help you to know that it's not narrated by the author or Oscar; most of the time, it's narrated by another character, Yunior (think Great Gatsby).  I didn't realize that until it was explicitly said around 1/3rd of the way through and that would have helped me understand what was happening so much better.  The last thing I want to mention is the history.  Some of this story takes place in the Dominican Republic and the author includes some history as well as some Spanglish.  I don't really know a whole lot about the DR except for the fact that they're on the same island as Haiti and they speak Spanish there (and I got to practice my Spanish by reading this book so that was cool!).  I found the whole history timeline to be really cool.  It's definitely good if you have a basic background knowledge of the DR but Diaz fills you in on the more specific stuff.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\nIf you don't like footnotes, it's probably best to skip this (or just skip reading the footnotes themselves).

Luckily the parts about the rest of his family were much more engaging, particularly in detailing life under the dictator Rafael Trujillo. I also liked that the narrator was a huge nerd who kept referencing things like The Lord of the Rings and Stephen King's The Stand (although since these references are never explained in much detail, I could see this being a drawback to a reader who wasn't familiar with those properties).

First of all I want to say I loved Daz other book of short stories called 'This Is How You Lose Her' based on Yunior and his writing style is gorgeous. This book has the same writing style that gets you hooked in and you can see what your reading. I don't even speak Spanish and I had no problem with that because it flowed so well. I'm definitely going to pick up Drown eventually but all of that does not mean I liked this book really. There is so much sadness in this story. I mean it is about a boy, or a family who is cursed and it's not clear that they know it. Your reading from someone else's perspective looking on at Oscar and his family, comparing themselves to The Watcher in marvel comics. I loved the nerd references throughout and it did help me connect with the characters because besides RPGs I loved the story's he connected them too. Oscar wants to be a Dominican Tolkien and it's a high goal to reach. There was a lot of the N word here and I can't speak on that so I'm just going to warn you it's there. Honestly I'd say there is a lot of racism in general, colorism is something I know nothing of being a white girl but it read it very distinctly in these pages. The author is Dominican himself so he's more than likely writing from very real experiences and I've literally no say in who it's represented. Honestly I'm so out of my league I'll stop even mentioning it here. I did not like how the women were treated in this novel. I know from his other book it's a Dominican thing and I mean let's be honest America treats women as second class a lot of times so it's not hard to over look. Oscar just wanted to be in love so bad to the point he loved all women and the descriptions that were often used I kind of hated. I know that's what your going to get though reading from the male gaze in a male perspective it just sucks is all. I will say that there were strong women too who overcame their adversities and were shown respect but that doesn't fix the amount called nasty words just because they lucked out being born female. Anyways, by the end I just had lost all kind of reason to care about what was going on. I really wanted to DNF but I was 150 pages in and I didn't bring another book to work with me.

{"ReviewerID": "A2DCS39GFBJV24", "ProductID": "B000UZJRGI", "Review": "Some redeeming features, but mostly unpleasant and problematic WARNING: Contains spoilers.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize seems to operate by the same rule of thumb that the Newbery Award and the Academy Awards do -- the more depressing and tragic the story, the more likely it is to win the prize. While not every Pulitzer-Prize winner falls in this category (the humorous \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" comes to mind), it does seem to me that works that grapple with dark and horrifying issues are far more likely to be nominated for the prize, and naturally most of these issues won't make for light, entertaining reading. So I suppose I should have known what I was getting into when I picked up \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,\" a prize-winner itself. But I felt I could identify with a main character who shared many of my own interests, and figured if nothing else, it could be an interesting read.\n\nWhile the historical bits of this book were fascinating, if shocking and often horrifying, the book itself is a miserable read, not helped by an unlikable narrator, unlikable characters, and a just plain depressing and unlikable storyline.\n\n\"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" tells the story of Oscar, the awkward and overweight teen son of a Dominican immigrant. Oscar is a fan of what the narrator calls \"the Genres\" -- fantasy, sci-fi, video games, anime, role-playing games, etc. -- and dreams of someday becoming a great writer on par with J. R. R. Tolkein. But Oscar also dreams of finding a girlfriend, a quest thwarted by his social awkwardness and his looks... not to mention his brutal, overprotective mother. Oscar's story doesn't stand alone, however, and woven throughout his narrative are other stories -- his older sister who struggles to break free from their mother's toxic parenting, his mother who grew up in horrific circumstances during the reign of a sadistic dictator, and his grandparents who made a powerful enemy in the leader of the Dominican Republic and lost everything, including their lives, to his vengeance. All this is told through the voice of Yunior, Oscar's college roommate, who has his own take on what happened to Oscar and his family... but can we trust his words?\n\nIn my opinion, the snippets of history included in this book (mostly in copious footnotes) was the best part of the book. I knew almost nothing about the Dominican Republic going into this book, and what I learned was shocking and even horrifying at times, but still fascinating. This truly is a country with a troubled history, one made all the worse by the United States' meddling.\n\nThe rest of the book is less fascinating, and seems to be one long unrelenting sea of tragedy and brutality inflicted on our main character and his family. Whether it's bullying, being targeted by the government, rape, attempted murder, emotional/verbal abuse, or just sheer bad luck, nothing seems to go right for our characters. Don't expect any moments of hope to last -- they're just there as a moment to catch your breath before the book plunges back into dumping as much pain and suffering on our characters as possible. I understand life is difficult, especially life in a third-world country run by a dictator, but at times the amount of tragedy piled onto the characters gets ridiculous.\n\nThe fact that said characters don't have many redeeming qualities themselves doesn't help matters. The author and narrator make no attempt to try to make Oscar likable or relatable -- instead he's just painted as a fat, whiny loser whose life sucks because he can't get a girlfriend. His sister is slightly more sympathetic but fairly nasty to her own brother, and his mother is downright abusive (yes, you can still be an abusive parent even if you don't beat your child...). The closest thing to a sympathetic character is La Inca, a family relative who raised Oscar's mother and who invites Oscar and his sister to stay with her every summer, and I can't help but think she would have been a better narrator than Yunior.\n\nWhich brings me to the narrator. People have praised this book for its \"unique\" and \"authentic\" narrator, but I despised the voice used for this novel. I didn't mind the slang and Spanish mixed into the book, but the profanity and frequent use of the N-word nearly made me stop reading altogether at some points. Foul language alone usually isn't enough to make me stop reading, but there is such a thing as too much. Also Yunior is just as nasty in his assessment and description of Oscar and his life as the characters who bully and abuse him, and it makes for unpleasant reading.\n\nThere's a lot of to-do in this book about some sort of curse placed on Oscar's family by the Dominican Republic's dictator. This results in a slight feel of \"magical realism,\" especially in a mongoose-like creature and a faceless man who both haunt some of the characters. It added an interesting angle to the story, and made things slightly more bearable.\n\nAs for the ending... it's supposed to come across as tragic, but the circumstances of Oscar's death feel less tragic and more stupid to me. I have little sympathy for Oscar's death when it's his own stupidity and hormones that got him killed, and said ending elicited a facepalm from me instead of tears. Not to mention that the final chapter of the book is supposed to be hopeful because Oscar finally got laid before he died. Seriously? I had hoped to find a kindred spirit of sorts in Oscar, but instead he turns out to be the stereotypical fat nerd who just wants to lose his virginity to a hot girl. *sigh*\n\nWhile this book has a few redeeming features, mostly in its chronicle of the Dominican Republic's turbulent and dark history, for the most part it was an unpleasant slog with a foul-mouthed narrator and characters both unsympathetic and frustratingly stupid. Perhaps the Pulitzer Prize jurists lap this sort of stuff up, but for me it represents what's wrong with a lot of \"serious\" literature -- it confuses \"dark and depressing\" with \"deep and meaningful\" and \"unlikable and unsympathetic\" with \"flawed and complex.\" And after reading several unpleasant novels that happened to be Pulitzer winners/finalists, I'm hesitant to ever pick up another.", "Feedback": "negative"}

If the back is to be believed, this is the insular tale of a Dominican nerd who lives in New Jersey and his girl problems. But it's not.\n\nThis is the story of a family running away from tyranny in the Dominican Republic and trying to find peace in the United States. This is the story of a family trying to figure out if they're cursed or not amid death, sadness, heartbreak and the Diaspora (with a capital D).\n\nFrom my perspective as a white woman born and raised in the United States by American parents, there's a lot of stuff in this book that just isn't meant for me to get. A bunch of it was in Dominican slang Spanish because it wasn't written for me. I'm glad we're getting to the point where we can have American narratives that aren't just about white people. Minorities can tell their stories for themselves instead of having to edit for, in this case, \"gringo\" audiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the overly long sections describing the early life of Oscar's mother in the DR dragged for me. I knew it was important, but I just couldn't get into the story. I also gave up on the expansive footnotes of the history of Dominican corruption and violence because it overwhelmed me. Additionally, the swapping narrators and shifts in time made it hard to follow exactly who was talking at what points.\n\nFinally, as a woman I had trouble connecting to Oscar as a protagonist. The concept that men deserve women's attention just for being nice frustrated me. The concept of \"nice guys finish last\" wore thin because i've been the woman who has the male friend she doesn't return the affections of and is forever enshrined in their consciousness's as a heartless bitch. I was frustrated with how Oscar never learned and grew. He remained stagnant.

{"ReviewerID": "AYFNOHE3IQQ4G", "ProductID": "B000UZJRGI", "Review": "From the Dominican Republic under Trujillo to Dungeons and Dragons in New Jersey and Back Again Wow! This Putlizer prize winning novel by Junot Diaz is tough to characterize. The story alternates narrators and jumps through time, telling the stories of an American teenagers Oscar de Le&oacute;n, his sister Lola, their mother Beli (who emigrated from the Dominican Republic), and their grandfather Abelard. Oscar is overweight, obsessed with science fiction and fantasy, and consequently has some trouble fitting in at school. Lola is rebellious against her not-so-affectionate mother. Although Oscar and Lola are American, the story keeps returning to the Dominican Republic, both in the present, as Oscar and Lola return to visit, and in the past, as we learn how the lives of Beli and Abelard were profoundly affected by the oppressive dictatorship of Trujillo. As one narrator puts it, \"Trujillo was Mobutu before Mobutu was Mobutu.\"\n\nIt took me a while to get into the book, but ultimately I couldn't put it down. Oscar keeps wanting to be better, but -- like so many of us -- he \"seem[s] to be allergic to diligence.\" The language -- quick moving and sharp -- moves fluidly between English and Dominican (Spanish) slang, with more references to science fiction and fantasy literature peppered in than I could keep up with. Diaz twists familiar tropes in interesting ways, as in his characterization of \"nerd heaven -- where every nerd gets 58 virgins to role play with.\" The allusions range from the explicit -- \"I'm going to be the Dominican Tolkien\" -- to the implicit but obvious -- \"\"Hiding your doe-eyed, large-breasted daughter from Trujillo, however, was...like keeping the ring from Sauron\" (Lord of the Rings) -- to the deep dive -- \"Sucks to be left out of adolescence, sort of like getting locked in the closet on Venus when the sun appears for the first time in a hundred years\" (which is an allusion to Ray Bradbury's wonderful story, \"All Summer in a Day\"). When Diaz tells of a Dominican teenager who rides a motorcycle between movie theaters because they share the reels to a single film, I recalled a similar sequence in the Italian film Cinema Paradiso.

I tried reading the book but I was caught up by the references made to local New Jersey references. I live by the old Amboy Cinemas mentioned in the novel. The novelist was raised only a few miles at London Terrace Apartment Complex in Old Bridge. We shared the same library. Junot Diaz has been nominated twice for the New Jersey Hall of Fame recently for his services to literature. This novel has won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and it is richly deserved.\n\nSo instead of reading the novel, I listened to an unabridged version of the novel at the gym and on bus ride to and from Atlantic City. The novel unfolds about Oscar De Leon, his sister Lola, Lola's boyfriend, his mother, and her father. Their lives are intertwined to explain their circumstances and motives. This novel is richly woven to even understand Oscar and Lola's cancer stricken mother. At first, the readers won't like her but her back story is richly developed to help understanding her.\n\nI hated the ending of the story as it is heartbreaking. The title clues you in about Oscar's life. Oscar is overweight and socially awkward with girls. He desires them but his appearance and obesity hinders possible relationships. He is able to make friends with girls but he is often heartbroken and even suicidal.\n\nReaders of all ages and backgrounds will connect with Oscar as the awkward outsider interested in science fiction and fantasy. He is also an avid aspiring writer himself. Books and writing have always been there for them when the world looked past him.\n\nPoor Oscar, he deserved so much more in life. We all do. I was almost in tears listening to the book on CD. It was actually better listening to the unabridged version. If you don't like reading, try listening to it on CD.

A fuk may affect generations, until someone along the line manages to find the right zafa to break the spell.\n\nIn a combination of Spanglish, slang, and the occasional made-up expression, Junot Daz effectively captures the spirit and evolved identity of a transplanted Latin American family onto U.S. culture. It touches upon the struggle of a society affected by oppressive power, and the resilience and determination needed in their diaspora. As a native Hispanic, I wonder if and how non-Spanish speakers get to fully understand this book, because it's written not only in Spanish but in Spanish (untranslateable) slang. Also, as a native Hispanic, I was annoyed at the multiple grammatical and spelling errors in Spanish. Couldn't Diaz have found a bilingual editor?\n\nThe book's chapters alternatively tell the story of Oscar and his immediate family members. Narrated by Yunior, Lola's on-again, off-again boyfriend, we learn of the De Len clan's woes and how fuk, inevitably, catches up with Oscar. From the title we are aware that Oscar will die, but that news does not lessen our sorrow because by then we are despairingly rooting for his success. Oscar's unquenchable thirst for love is heart-wrenching because it is snubbed by every female he encounters. \"His affection --that gravitational mass of love, fear, longing, desire, and lust that he directed at any and every girl in the vicinity without regard to looks, age, or availability-- broke his heart [and ours] each and every day\". His family members and their struggles also break our hearts in their own struggles to survive their personal hell.\n\nAs for the dose of Dominican history included in the book, I am so curious about Trujillo now that I will follow with Julia Alvarez's \"In the time of the butterflies\" and Mario Vargas Llosa's \"La fiesta del chivo\".

I think the title is misleading as Oscar Wao actually played quite a small role in it and I don't believe the author drew enough parallels to the larger story.\n\nThe book is mostly a history of the Dominican Republic with most of the emphasis resting on the reign of terror imposed by the ruler for 31 years, Trujillo.  While this was very interesting, the book is laced with nerdy references that don't strike me as the kind of thing someone interested in Dominican history would understand.  If the phrase \"He took 400 hit points of damage\" for instance, doesn't make sense to you, then you should probably pass on this book.\n\nAnother thing I didn't care for was the over use of harsh language and the frequent use of Spanish words and phrases with no translation.  Tossing in a 'chica' or 'loco' every now and then is fine since the words are commonly known even by the least capable of linguists, but there were quite a few longer phrases and less commonly understood words throughout the book.\n\nI think the main character was just a bit too unbelievable and his life not wondrous at all.\n\nThat said, I DID enjoy the history and I respect the author for writing a book that was clearly close to his heart.\n\nI listened to this on audio CD's I got from my library and the reader was awesome!", "Feedback": "moderate"}

The narration is balanced (sometimes overly so) with footnotes tell you about what happened to a particular side character or historical person, and theres an epic feel to this tale. Yet, in a the-honeymoons-over type of way, I was disappointed in this novel. Diazs collection of short stories Drown is one of my all-time favorites, and while that was fantastic, this is merely quite good. He still merges humor with tragedy, and comes up with amazing descriptions to combine life and language in the Dominican Republic with a more American existence. It was an enjoyable read, but nothing like the (for me) dizzying heights set by his short stories.\n\nGreater Detail:\nOscar Wao is a New Jersey boy who is obsessed with becoming the Dominican version of J.R.R. Tolkien via an unfinished four-book science fiction epic. Oscar thinks hes a G when talking about role-playing games and worries seriously about being the only Dominican male to die a virgin. Though he eventually gets a love story of his own (falling in love with Ybon, an aging prostitute in Santo Domingo), quite a bit of this novel details the various trials of his family  grandparents who suffered at the hands of El Trujillo, a cousin named La Inca who cared for Oscars mother, the beautiful final daughter who eventually morphs into Oscars skinny, workaholic mother whos struggling with cancer.\n\nDiazs writing is forceful and unapologetic, and there are many times when you're carried along by the writing, where you have barely enough time to wonder about whether being a (@#$) vs a snort-addicted mess is stereotypical or unique characterization for a prostitute and find out that a cop-divorce is synonymous with a bullet. Still, there are times when the style almost becomes a stumbling block for the story  the first-person narrator whose identity shifts, the lack of punctuation that adds greatly to the speed of the novel but sometimes, similar to long Hemingway dialogues, leaves you wondering where and who is speaking, etc.\n\nFurther, despite the title, Oscars story feels almost like it could be a footnote in the story  the parts with his mothers transformation (though more predictable) are compelling, and the grandparents and their history is one of the strongest sections. By the time we loop back around to our protagonist, hes somehow less interesting, a bit anticlimactic. Were told that this is a cursed family, that fu&u (curse) is at work here, and weve seen the dramatic effects this has had through prior generations so that Oscars eventual downfall feels like the weakest of the set\n\nComparisons to Other Books:\nDiaz is an amazing writer  the pacing, the style, and the language are unique and at times, like I said, almost compulsively readable. Still, I found Drown to be angry, raw and compelling in a way that this just wasnt.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The story is non-linear and covers a time span that goes from 1944 to 1995. There is a part that follows the life of the Cabrales American children in the USA following a natural chronology and line of events, while another part tells the story of their parents and grandparents from the present to the past, in reverse order.\n\nDiaz's narrative is fresh, powerful, captivating, humorous and extremely original. His characters are unforgettable, well drawn, multifaceted and realistic, warm and close as if they were real people you have known for years - perhaps because they are based on true people. Not a moment of boredom - guaranteed.\n\nThe book gets you hooked from the very beginning. It is its characters, the many stories told in it, its humanity and credibility, the historical period that focus on the Dominican Republic, and the real portray of the challenges, sufferings and process of survival and adaptation of the Dominican Diaspora in the USA.\n\nThe book is written mostly in English, but with a lot of Spanish paragraphs and phrasing, without any translation given (at least in the edition I used). Beyond the proper Spanish, you will also find the Spanglish used by modern generations of Latinos in the USA, which can be tricky to understand, too. You certainly need a good knowledge of both English and Spanish to read the book with easiness, and to get its vibe. The truth is that the book is very organic in its multilingualism, and that is because of it, and not despite it, that the book is believable and so very charming. At the same time, this is a very difficult book to translate into Spanish or into any other language, unless you provide translation footnotes, or even if you do. It is impossible to reproduce in reverse what the book says without losing content, style, freshness and credibility, because the language used is embossed in the cultural and personal experiences of the characters. A good reason to learn Spanish or English!\n\nThe book contains footnotes explaining and detailing some of the historical background and figures mentioned in the story - the historical grip that makes the history understandable to those readers who, like me, are not familiar with the contemporary history of the Dominican Republic and with the Trujillato, i. e.  the dark terrible years of the Trujillo's dictatorship and the policies of repression and extermination carried out by his regime.\n\nThe book deserves the hype and good reviews that has had in the past years.

The chapters are self enclosed novellas that could stand aloneas a matter of fact, for the fun of it they can be read in the order written or in the chronology of what they tell.  Sort of like Rayuela  by the Argentinean Julio Cortzar, which invites the reader to choose between a linear and a non-linear mode of reading.\n\nThe narrator introduces the reader to the curse called fuk, especially associated with the Trujillo dictatorship, vs. Zafa the antidote to the curse.  Unfortunately, scar Waos story is dominated by the first.\n\nThe first novella The ghettosat  the end of the worldnerd 1974  1987, introduces us to scar  at age seven, and his blessed childhood when he was a womanizer having up to two girlfriends at a time.

She goes through several sexual escapades culminating in Santo Domingo where she falls for a married gansterwhos very jealous wife almost kills her in a sugar cane plantation, brought back to life by her Aunt La Inca: Myots Altagracia Toribio Cabral.\n\nThe third  novella The three misfortunes of Belicia Cabral 1955  1962, deals with the life of Hypata Belicia Cabral, scars mother.  We see her at age 13, working with her auntLa Incaat her bread shop, sleeping together in the same bed, until Belicia develops a stupendous body and the same fights that she had with her daughter are now seen with her adoptive mother. At age 15, she escapes her mother and goes to work for Juan Then in a Chinese restaurant.  Her figure, wits and savvy make the Chinese restaurant a success.  Like her daughter she falls for one of Trujillo's married gangsters and like her daughter the wife, orders her killed and she ends in another sugar cane plantation, but survives and La Inca nourishes her back to life.\n\nThe fourth  novella Sentimental Education 1988-1992 is narrated by Junior (Yuni) and tells us about the four years scar spent at Rutgers University in New Brunswickhis inability to find women and how he gets his nickname.  At one point Yuni informs scar one of my favorite lines of the novel: It goes against the laws of nature that a Dominican will die without having sex at least once. p. 185\n\nThe fifth novella Poor Abelard 1944-1946 tells us the background of the family.  Dr. Abelardo Luis Cabral a famous surgeon and rich merchant.  He had two daughters.  He enjoyed a prominent life; had servants and several homes.  He had a wife, Socorro, two daughters Jacquelyn and Astrid, and a lover, Lydia.  Unfortunately the fuk takes hold of the family when Jacquelyn  develops into a beauty.  You see, in Trujillos time, any beautiful woman belonged to the dictator and parents had to let the dictator have his way with them or suffer the consequences.  Lydia warned Abelardo and wanted to take Jacquelyn  out of the country but Abelardo refused.  Instead he hid his wife and daughters from the dictator.  But it was to no avail.  Dr. Cabral receives an invitation from Trujillo to attend The Independence day Ball and it includes his wife and daughters namethe last one was underlined three times.  Unable to give his daughter to the dictator he attends the party alone.  Within months he is in prison.  Trujillo sentences him to twelve years for treason for an innocent comment he made and confiscates all the family wealth.  But the fuk does not end there, Jacquelyn, although her virginity was saved,  goes to live with her Godparents to end up dying in a swimming pool with two feet of water, days after she was accepted to go to medical school in Paris.  Astrid goes to live with relatives and in 1955, while attending church, a stray bullet kills her.  Socorro is pregnant with  Belicia, but she comes out as black as charcoal, unlike the rest of the family. Right after the delivery Socorro is killed by a carmore fukand the relatives that claim the baby from a prior employee of the family, Zoila, who nursed her to life against all odds, sell the girl.  She becomes a slave and is burnt terribly until by an act of Zafa occurs and by coincidence La Inca hears about a relative she has.  She rescues Belicia from slavery and cures her burs both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>The sixth novella The land of the lost 1992-1995 has Oscar teaching at his old high school, Don Bosco in Jersey. He decides to visit Santo Domingo with his family.  Now we get a description of the post Trujillo era in the Dominican Republic, where scar becomes Huscar and he is addressed in English..  La Inca has prospered and now has six stores in the Capital, Santo Domingo, and a brand new house.  Unfortunately the house is next to the home of Ybn Pimentel, a prostitute who is the wife of a colonel in the new right wing government.  Our hero cant prevent ithis fuk makes him fall in love with Ybn and he is caught kissing her by the jealous husband.  The same scene of driving with two policemen to a sugar cane field is repeated and scar  is saved because the evangelical taxi driver that is friend of La Inca followed them and managed to get him to the hospital.  Against everyone wishes, scar  refuses to go back to the states until a big family intervention gives him no choice (aided by stray bullets at La Incas house).\n\nThe seventh novella The Last Trip involves scars return to Santo Domingo to pursue his love, Ybn  and ends with his death at the sugar cane field.\n\nThe eighth novella The End of the Story has Junior describing the recovering of the body, Lola marrying in Miami and a letter from scar describing his love affair with Ybn prior to dying.\n\nThe book is heavily influenced by Frank Herberts Dune and J.

It goes without saying that it won the Pulitzer Prize and earned Diaz a MacArthur Genius Award.

Based on that premise alone, it's hard to imagine a publishing house rushing to publish this novel.  I myself, a Spanish major in college who has lived abroad for long stretches and has a more than passing interest in the history of Latin America, would not have rushed to the store to buy a book about this tiny, poor Caribbean nation.  Couching such a history lesson as a story of one family's immigration and assimilation into the US over the course of several generations has been done successfully before, and that overall story structure serves this tale well.  The author deftly weaves together the various generations of the DeLeon family, going easily between the present and the past and gradually letting the reader discover the indignities both small and large that people living under a military dictatorship must endure.  Other than a few chapters in the middle where I thought the tale lingered a bit too long on the sexual coming-of-age of a secondary character, the writing is wonderful, and yet would not have been sufficient to catapult this novel into the stratosphere of the Pulitzer were it not for the amazing protagonist.\n\nAs the title states, the book is really about the life of one individual named Oscar.  Oscar is a scifi geek living in New Jersey in the 1990's and he is one of the most unique characters I have ever encountered in fiction.  Being a bit of a scifi geek myself and knowing many, many \"Oscars,\" I found him loveable, compelling and completely realistic.

The killing brought no luck to the assassins, including way up to the top of the command chain. Why else did JFK get killed but for the curse of Trujillo? (The word for the curse cannot be written here, it goes against zoo rules.)\nSo much for history. (Santo Domingo was Iraq before Iraq was Iraq.)\nIt is perfectly ok for you not to believe in these curses, these superstitions. They believe in you. That is enough.\n\nA book about a boy, an obese Sci-fi nerd and a suicidal loner. Oscar's problem is that he loves girls, but they don't love him. In a macho culture that makes him a sad misfit. Also a book about his sister and her mother troubles. And much about their mother, an orphan thanks to the goat, and her men troubles. And her cancer troubles. Mother and daughter share an inextinguishable longing for elsewheres.\nRacism is part of the plot. The family has unwhite influences. The goat had many Haitians, including their mixed race offspring, killed.\n\nThe language of the main narrator is refreshingly foulmouthed, which stands in contrast to the complex narrative structure and the overload of allusions to all kinds of worlds. Also in contrast to the essentially tragic story.\nI am not a scifi nerd or fantasy fan myself, therefore many names are lost on me. Doesn't seem to matter much. The narrator is an involved person, but is slow to disclose his identity. Takes him about half through the novel. The explanation for the name Wao comes a few pages later. No spoilers.\n\nIn two chapters, Oscar's sister Lola (a Dolores like the original Lolita) narrates, as if JD wanted to try it out. Those are, frankly, weaker. I wonder, maybe he can't plausibly impersonate a woman? He wouldn't be the first male writer with a problem in that department.\n\nI do not always agree with the Pulitzers for fiction, but this time the choice was right.\nI think I might have had some difficulties of comprehension had I not read the Vargas Llosa  book recently.

And some in an obscure dialect spoken only by a people who huddle together in dank rooms called \"comic book shops\" and on obscure internet chat boards. While I only know a few words of Spanish and couldn't follow along, I speak fluent geek and could understand every word of Oscar Wao's inane babble.\n\nI was impressed with how accurate Junot Diaz's geekology was. Every reference, every quote, is exactly right.

{"ReviewerID": "A3AI7W35TRCRE1", "ProductID": "B000UZJRGI", "Review": "The Brief And Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Diaz Let me preface this with a personal disclaimer. This was not an easy book to navigate with an audio version because of the many Spanish words and colloquialisms which I did not recognize. With a visual, I could have looked back, checked the spelling, looked up words, and perhaps I would have found the book far more entertaining. I found some of the subject matter very distasteful and the language unnecessarily profane. The most vulgar language and sexual descriptions left little to the imagination. Although the descriptions were apt and spot on, they were sometimes absolutely gross. I was not a bit interested in reading graphic descriptions of violent, senseless beatings or gratuitous, sadistic sex that did not in any way enhance the story. As in \"A Visit From The Goon Squad\" by Jennifer Egan, the language and descriptive sex in this novel, detracted from its beauty.\nThe book is written with subtle humor even as it describes horrific scenes. The characters are not very likeable as they are all very nave and ill informed, making poor judgments leading to abysmal consequences in their lives. They never seem to learn from experience and repeat the same mistake, generation after generation, choosing the wrong mate and the wrong path to follow, hence the aura of a curse around the family.\nThat said, the author did a masterful job of setting the time and place. Through the history of Oscar Wao's troubled family, beginning with his grandfather, Abelard, in the Dominican, and continuing with Oscar's upbringing, we learn what it was like for him to live and grow up in Patterson, NJ, as well as in the Dominican Republic, right under the nose of Trujillo. He forces the reader to experience the brutality of the regime. We learn of the fucu, the faceless man, the dreams and the tragedies that befell this family, generation after generation.\nThe history of Oscar's family is filled with despair. Under the Trujillo regime, his family was stripped of their wealth and prominence. It was an oppressive regime which left no records of its monstrous cruelty to individuals. Oscar's cousin was destroyed by friends, the very friends who turned him in with their lies, who then became the recipients of some of his wealth. It was a corrupt society, hopeless. Oscar believes his family has a background based in superstition or the supernatural, that it is cursed. He is very intelligent and very creative with a wild imagination.\nOscar's mom had a hard life in the Dominican Republic and she moved to the states. Oscar grows up in Paterson, New Jersey with his sister. He is a loser, a nerd; he has no social life, has no social skills and is not especially pleasant looking, being overweight and wearing glasses, among other things. He is a misfit from a broken home; his father left his mom after 3 years of marriage. His mom is a taskmaster who rarely gives compliments or encouragement and his sister eventually runs away and is sent back to the Dominican to live with a cousin. We continue to follow Oscar as he grows up but never seems to fulfill his dreams. He is unsuccessful with women and has few friends. When he finally doe, succeed, it is in the Dominican Republic, and it is a tragic and final ending.\nThere are several concurrent narratives, causing some confusion. The narrator, Yunior, relates the highlights of the different character's lives. For a time, they seem to have no connection, but eventually, all the parts coalesce. There is Beli, Oscar's mother; Lola, Oscar's sister; Yunior, his \"so-called\" best friend; La Inca, Beli's cousin; Ybon, Oscar's true love and others. They all have their own stories; they all come from the Dominican. It is an immigrant's story, a story about superstitions and fantasies, nightmares and dreams, dysfunctional families, doomed relationships, poor choices, abandoned hopes and unattainable dreams and desires.\nHaving lived in NJ, I found the places mentioned in the book a walk down memory lane. I remembered with fondness, the drive-in, in Perth Amboy; the amusement park in Wildwood, NJ; Rutgers University.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

I also wonder whether anybody will be talking about Junot Diaz 10 years from now.\n\nI like the energy, exuberance even, of the language, harnessed to a truly original voice. The admixture of Spanish faithfully reflects the polyglot's tendency to use the best word to describe something, even if it means mixing languages.\n\nI like the portrayal of Dominican life, both in Santo Domingo and New Jersey. The collage of Dominican history, the vivid description of the Trujillo terror, the insider look at another culture are all enriching.\n\nI like the character of Oscar, his nerdiness, his life of comic books and video games. Diaz conveys all this with such authority that you feel like something of a nerd yourself reading it.\n\nThere are some things I don't like. I don't think we get inside Oscar enough. The narrator(s) remain detached really, and we have only vague notions of what's going on inside Oscar.\n\nI don't like the author's glorification of the sexual prowess of Dominican men. For, make no mistake about it, while he seems to be making fun of it and couches many of his observations as ironic, there is more braggadocio here than satire. After all, the chief frustration of Oscar's brief life -- hardly wondrous -- is not getting laid, and this frustration arises in great part because of the unapologetic insistence of Yunior and everyone else in Oscar's life that this is the ultimate good in life. (Spoiler alert) So when we learn through a posthumous note that Oscar in fact does achieve this elusive goal -- in an impossibly contrived way -- we can indeed view his life now as wondrous.\n\nThere is in fact so little in the book in terms of moral choice -- all the characters are carried along by forces beyond their control, above all the tiresome fuku -- that I suspect it is in fact a superficial novel, dazzling in the virtuosity of its language but not destined for a long shelf life.\n\nYunior's priapism costs him the love of his life, but he seems to come to terms with it pretty easily. It's not so much that he learns any lessons or makes any choices, he just kind of runs out of energy after sowing his wild oats.\n\nOscar is pathetic, not tragic. His life is not wondrous, but sad.

That turned out not to be the case, although for me it was just incredible.\n\nBrief summary, no spoilers.\n\nThis is a story about a young man named Oscar Wao and his \"cursed\" family, and it is also a story about the Dominican Republic. We learn about the horrors suffered by the people under the rule of Truijllo, \"The Dictatingest Dictator who ever Dictated.\"\n\nThe story goes back and forth in time, and the foreshadowing in early chapters about the suffering of various characters is explained later on. Despite the fact that this can be a lough out loud funny and witty book, the author pulls no punches and torture and abuse are often described in heartbreaking detail.\n\nI thought the book was brilliant. Oscar Wao is an overweight oddball kid who loves science fiction and reading is obsessed with finding a girlfriend and losing his virginity. He seems inept at both. As much as we, the readers, grow to love Oscar and see him as the good-hearted and special man that he is, he is mistreated by so many others and ostracized by others for his eccentricities. He is not recognized for the diamond that he is except by his family, and especially his sister Lola and her sometimes boyfriend Yunior.\n\nThis is an unusual book, and there are often science fiction and fantasy references - which are helpful if you are familiar with them. Books such as Lord of the Rings, or Dune, or the Narnia series to just name a few. There's also mention of Twilight Zone episodes, and various role playing games and video and movies. I recognized most of them, and thought they were used brilliantly to take us into Oscar's mind and world.  Also helpful is knowing Spanish - which I (sort of) do.\n\nI suppose this book is not for anyone, since clearly there are plenty of negative reviews and my book club was evenly divided. But for me this was an exceptional read. I think this is one of those books that you will know right away if it's your cuppa or not - just read the first twenty pages and if you're not enjoying it by then, then it's probably not going to get better for you.

Obscenely overweight, with a penchant for sci-fi and using huge ponderous words which no one uses (or understands), his hip-quotient is sorely impeded whether in New Jersey where he lives or Santo Domingo where his family originates. Nonetheless, Oscar falls hopelessly in love with one hot chico after another who would rather cross the street than to walk by him. And to add to all that misery, he has the family fuku (or curse) that has transcended down the generations to contend with.\n\nEvery bit the loser and misfit, Oscar's story is told by a funny, streetsmart and omniscient narrator, Yunior, a college roommate and sometime boyfriend of Oscar's older sister, Lola, a Siouxsie and the Banshees-styled athletic goth , who also takes on part of the narrative to give a more rounded perspective of Oscar and his mother Beli, as well as the love-hate mother-daughter relationships that are passed down the generations just like the alleged fuku.\n\nAlong the way, we applaud the indefatigable Oscar as he tries desperately to lose weight, to fit in with his college-mates and garner some street cred even as he strives to become the Dominican Tolkien in the stories he copiously writes in his dorm room, and to ultimately find a woman who could look at him and not turn away in disgust.\n\nInterspersed in this narrative are interesting and shocking historical footnotes about dictator Trujillo's rule over the Dominican Republic, with whom Oscar's family is inexplicably intertwined with; from his grandfather, a wealthy doctor, to his mother, Beli's entanglement with one of Trujillo's henchmen, and finally to himself, and the tragedies that unfold with each encounter.\n\nDiaz has the enviable gift of being able to write as convincingly about the private dramas of a fat frat boy as well as the larger implications of the political dictatorship, while dealing with the more supernatural realm of family curses and bad luck in a story about family relationships (in sharp Spanglish, no less) that is poignant and extremely enjoyable.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The epigraphs tell us of the importance of brief,nameless lives. That one person could be a nation. The book is about a real individual:nerdy,sci-fi lover,fat,virginal Oscar. This is not the coming of age story of an immigrant in America,since as it unfolds the story expands backwards into a history of the Dominican Republic:a story of mother and grandparents like ripples expanding outwards. The structure is important. The deeper into Oscar's life we push the more present his history becomes,a history he never becomes aware of,only the reader gets to assemble all the pieces. The narrator, his college friend, relates Oscar's story backwards with a nod to the the fuku curse that has stricken the family over the generations and to Oscar's living through fantasy sci-fi,The Watchmen,Lord of the Rings,X-men,dungeons- and- dragons escapism for the boy who cannot pull girls and to ward off the terror of the evils of Trujilloism.\n\nOscar and his family live now in Paterson,New Jersey exiled from the Dominican Republic for good reasons. He is a writer and dreams of becoming the next Tolkein while falling hopelessly in and out of love. His punk sister, Lola, wants to run away, and his resolute mother,Beli, Beli can't seem to let either of them go. We get major footnotes throughout the novel recounting the ruthless brutality of the Trujillo dictatorship of 31 years. The novel is about words, as curses,,superstitiouns, spells,charms or writing. The power of words to fight the silences,the abscences,the lacunae,disappearance:our ability to construct a narrative through the imagination. Most of our history gets wiped out by the anaesthetic of the quotidian or by censorship.

All the characters wear the mask, behind which is the United States. We are in `the Americas'and the first contact of alien races occurred in the Caribbean's `ground zero', Santo Domingo, breeding enslavement,absurdity,atrocities,mind control,bodies torn to pieces and reassembled again. Genre narratives were dealing with these darker corners of human experience,secret histories,only Trujillo escapes its wildest imaginings,being truly evil. The novel written with a blistering energy has the force of flowing lava absorbing all the argot of Spanish and street slang and the geeky references to sci-fi into a new immigrant- enriched American English.

{"ReviewerID": "A2IKY4WH4E11AI", "ProductID": "B000UZJRGI", "Review": "Intense, Mystical, Magical -- and Horrifying I haven't read a lot of fiction by Latin American writers or writers with a Latin American sensibility, but I've noticed a pattern.  Junot Dias, like the better-known Gabriel Garcia Marquez, crafts stories that are complicated and dense, and they play with reality in ways that are, well, \"foreign\" to me.  Miracles happen.  Curses (fuku) are cast, and they apparently work.  People have visions and they foretell the future.  The dead return, or at least they visit the living in dreams and visions.\n\nI don't live that way.  Maybe people in Latin American do.  Maybe only authors imagine that they do.  Regardless, it's an intoxicating way to look at life.\n\n\"The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" fits squarely in this framework.  Many reviewers have noted that the book more or less follows the youth and young adulthood of a Dominican-American named Oscar who grows up poor in Paterson, New Jersey, in the 1990s.  But I feel that this severely understates the richness of the book.  Oscar's life is only one of numerous complicated and \"wondrous\" plotlines, and, to my way of thinking, not necessarily even the most interesting.\n\nBut let's begin with Oscar anyway.  He is an intellectual geek who never finds his place in an environment in which toughness, machismo, violence, and sex appeal rule the lives of everyone.  He's fat, prone to using big words, and a dreamer (mostly about fantasy role-playing games).  Oscar is the one guy who can't get laid, even though he never gives up trying to entice girls.\n\nOscar's sister is so different that people scarcely believe they are siblings. Lola is a brilliant beauty who goes off-track (literally off-track when she drops her budding sprinting career) for several years before righting herself, finishing college, and moving out of the barrio.  She's a mirror image of her mother, Beli, a legendary beauty who used her looks and fierce determination to escape from the DR -- though not without suffering deep, permanent scars (physical as well as emotional).  And Lola is pursued for a while by Yunior, the narrator of the book, who's the Dominican-American that Oscar wanted to be: musculed, handsome, bedding a new chick every week.  Then, there's La Inca, the aunt or cousin of Beli, who adopted her and nursed her back to physical and mental health --- only to lose Beli to the lures of men and wealth.  The stories of these three dynamos are told in the book, and each is at least as compelling as Oscar.\n\nMeanwhile, history is almost a character itself, too.  The lives of the characters are buffeted by history, namely the sad, sordid history of the Dominican Republic in the 20th century, a time wracked by an oppressive U.S. presence that gave way to a brutal 30-year right-wing dictatorship of Trujillo that gave way to years of reprisals and vengeance after his assassination in the 1960s.  Today, the DR is still in recovery and still suffering from the effects of a miserable goverment and economy that sends most people with promise scurrying to the U.S. in a continuing diaspora.  The book is about all of these compelling stories -- and more.\n\nAuthor Junot Diaz does a masterful job of weaving these stories together.  He  gives the reader a genuine insight into living in disfunctional urban America, in which getting through a school day without needing hospitalization is a triumph.  He gives the reader an equally deep understanding of the insanity of life in a violent dictatorship, and how people would try to go about their lives while steering clear of the angry, murderous people in power.  And then, Dias cuts across those worlds with characters who both live in them in the moment, but also aspire to something different and better.  You ache for the unfilled promise of Oscar, the tragedies that befell his mother, and the traumas and disappointments that so many other faced.\n\nHowever, this book isn't for the faint of heart.  It's violent, sexist, gross, and cruel.  Women are either sex objects or recovering from being sex objects.  Men are predators.  People are beaten, raped, and killed.  Almost nobody gets out alive.\n\nThe book also isn't for the weak of mind.  It's complicated, and the footnotes about DR history are essential for the average reader. (However, I don't know if they are fully accurate, and I am sure that they reflect a one-sided opinion about the country's history.)  There's a great deal of Spanish, both formal and slang.  A glossary would have helped immensely.  Some of the richness of the language was lost on me, due to my unfamiliarity with the worlds portrayed, and I'm sure that has frustrated many of the readers who gave the book low marks.\n\nBut if you're willing to work harder than you'd typically have to do for best-seller, you'll be richly rewarded with images of times, places, events, and people that are unforgettable.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The story is told in a real New Yorker/Dominican voice - meaning lots of Spanglish. It is very graphic in nature, has a lot of cussing and has some tough patches that were a bit difficult to get through - but were needed to get gist of the story. There were huge footnotes, which tend to distract me, but had a lot of insight on the history of Santo Domingo, D.R. I found it to be hilarious, educational and brimming with \"did he just write that\" moments.\n\nOh, and if you were wondering about the title, the title of the book gets its name, from the thick-accented pronunciation of Oscar Wilde, becoming Oscar \"Wao.\"", "Feedback": "positive"}

After a choppy and at times almost schizophrenic beginning, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao gets better.  The last 100 pages are infinitely more enjoyable than the first.  Diaz's writing feels very alive, and he does a nice job bringing the reader into the culture of his Dominican characters.  If you are 100 pages in and are about to throw this book against the wall (like I was), I suggest you keep going.  It is still nothing more than a shallow love story with a lot of quirks...but at least it becomes readable.\n\nBut even though it got better, it was still a disappointment.  The story labors along with great difficulty as Diaz seemed to lose his way through tangential character histories that read like stream-of-conscious thoughts.  While the book is supposed to be about Oscar Wao, there are more pages dedicated to his mother's past, yet there is no direct connection between her tragic experiences and Oscar's life.  It made the time spent on her background incidental to the story.  The same is true of the pages used to describe Oscar's grandfather and his tragic fate at the hands of Rafael Trujillo, the real-life horrendous dictator of the Dominican Republic in the 1930's.  While interesting, Diaz fails to tie all these pieces together in any way. Instead, he blames \"fuku\", a family curse he mentions in the beginning of the book, then seems to forget about, then re-introduces later when it must have been clear that he needed a reason why he told us all these stories.\n\nAs for the main character, Oscar is a not particularly likable, overweight nerd who's idea of love is really just an obsession with sex.  He is supposedly crazy about writing too, but we never learn about what, so it's pretty much irrelevant.  As for his life: Brief, yes.  Wondrous?  Hardly.\n\nFurther, there is a LOT of Spanish in this book, and none of it is translated.  Since I only know a small amount of Spanish and don't make a habit of carrying a Spanish/English dictionary with me, I just skimmed the Spanish lines and had to infer their meaning.  It was so annoying I came very close to putting it down.  Why should I know Spanish to read your marginal work of fiction that is written, and marketed, in ENGLISH?  There are also very long footnotes you would expect in a non-fiction book that completely distract from any kind of pace.  At times it is difficult to tell if Diaz is trying to educate or entertain.\n\nWhen I was about 80 pages into this book, I remember going back to the cover to double check, thinking to myself, \"It did say PULITZER, didn't it?\".", "Feedback": "moderate"}

There are elements of all these things in OSCAR WAO, so perhaps the Pulitzer is not such a stretch after all, except that Junot Daz takes everything that much farther.\n\nFor one thing, the book is interlarded throughout with Spanish words and phrases, resulting in exchanges like the following:\n--- She was very guapa, I said casually.\n--- Abuela snorted. Guapa soy yo. Your mother was a diosa. But so cabeza dura. When she was your age we never got along.\n--- I didn't know that, I said.\n--- She was cabeza dura and I was . . . exigente.\nAt least this passage uses more or less normal Spanish, but elsewhere the language is regional, street slang, or as often as not obscene. Yet Daz combines it with English in such a way that you don't need to know what everything means in order to be swept away:\n--- She was one of those golden mulatas that French-speaking Caribbeans call chabines, that my boys call chicas de oro; she had snarled, apocalyptic hair, copper eyes, and was one whiteskinned relative away from jaba.\"\n\nOscar de Len is the son of a Dominican refugee from the Trujillo regime, living in Paterson, New Jersey. A science fiction, Tolkien, and fantasy games addict, he is super-intelligent, grossly overweight, a total nerd, and completely incapable of fulfilling his dream of getting a girlfriend. The story is told partly by Oscar's onetime roommate Yunior (aka Daz), who has no such problems and who has an on-and-off relationship with Oscar's sister Lola, and partly by Lola herself. The present-day story in America alternates with chapters in the Dominican Republic from the forties through the sixties, which is a gangster nightmare stemming from the example of the psychopathic dictator himself. Daz changes voices like a ventriloquist, writing now like a teenage girl, now a street hoodlum, now plunging into noir like a Latino Dashiell Hammett, now compiling mock-erudite footnotes in the manner of David Foster Wallace.\n\nBut always his writing is both an exhilaration and a challenge. Whether you will enjoy it or not depends upon your tolerance for Spanish slang and ubiquitous sexuality. The reward is getting to know a slice of history, a vibrant immigrant culture, and a hero who, for all his faults, still manages to arouse our sympathy.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The short answer is no and here's why.\n\nThe book isn't really about Oscar Wao ; it's about his multigenerational family, including his mother Beli and his sister Lola, whose stories are arguably more colourful than Oscar's. Dominican Republicans believe they are cursed by the fuku because life under the unholy mid-20th century fascist terror regime was so unpredictable nobody could be certain of waking up the next day alive. The country's leader and his henchmen behave like war lords - they took whatever and whoever they fancied, so kidnap, rape and murder was a daily occurrence. We get our history lesson from a rather confusing non-linear narrative that jumps around quite a bit, each segment voiced by a different person, depending on whose story is being told. We are also distracted by long copious footnotes that sometimes take up half the page about DR's holy terror, his almost-as-terrifying sidekicks, and major events of the times. A rather messy way of giving readers context.\n\nTaken at another level, the fuku is simply the curse of living. Which child doesn't know the pain of rejection from not conforming to social standards ? In that sense, Oscar's blues seem rather unexceptional. Not unexpectedly, his mother - a rebellious red hot filly in her youth who tragically caught the wrong person's eye -takes a path that would mirror that of his sister. Lola wanted freedom and fought like a tigress to escape her mother's clutches...but Beli knew better, didn't she...after what happened to her. The circle seems destined never to be broken - that's life's fuku.\n\nDiaz's prose is mad and manic - the mixed language is a heady cocktail that makes reading unimaginably difficult for readers unfamiliar with Spanish. What this book needs is a glossary of terms for reference. It would also benefit from tighter editing. Overated and unworthy of the hype.", "Feedback": "moderate"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2PR6NXG0PA3KY", "ProductID": "B000UZJRGI", "Review": "Magic Realism in New Jersey? Here it is, the essential Search for Snatch novel for the current generation in the Diversified States of America. I've read it before -- German, French, Japanese, Swedish, English, Yiddish, some of those in translation -- Augie March, Last Picture Show, On the Road, This Side of Paradise, Confederated Dunces -- goofy-sad, wicked-weird, ecstatic, demure, downtrodden, redemptive, obsessive, etc. Honestly, I could just as easily give this novel one star as five, and for the same reasons. The author, Junot Diaz, tries way too hard, flaunts his mojo too blatantly, goes for style over substance. But he's also fairly good at it, hecka funny at times, killer smart. That's literature, in my view; if you like it, you like it.\n\nSo I liked it, I guess, but I had to work hard at it. Not for the reasons you might expect: I had no problem with the Spanish or the barrio slang. I know enough about the Dominican Republic -- the US interventions, Trujillo, Balaguer, the basic stuff that justifies anti-gringo rage -- to relish Diaz's brief but pertinent interpolated history lessons. What nearly stymied me was the plethora of literary allusions, a lot of them mere throwaways for the sake of coolth... allusions to computer games I've never played, sci-fi and wizardy novels I've never read, fantasy films I've never seen. Okay, okay, writers tend to pile that member-of-the-club stuff on the hapless reader; you have to plow through it on the assumption that it isn't necessary to know an orc from a dork, any more than reading Nabokov requires knowing one moth from another. But eventually I got the inkling that Diaz meant something specific with all his pop pedantry. In which case, think of the footnotes that will be required if this novel outlasts its current fans and gets read in the next century! What an opportunity for grad-student seminar papers! What a PhD thesis in waiting!\n\nThere's also the issue of empathy. Of identification with character, which is BIG in contemporary fiction. To put it bluntly, I couldn't. The title character -- Oscar Wao, the 'Wao' being Domo pronunciation of 'Wilde' -- is SO NOT ME. But neither is the authorial narrator, or any of the less developed characters, most of whom are cartoonish. In the end, I actually felt guilty about my revulsion from Oscar; I knew that I'd have been one of his persecutors if he'd dared to hit on me for sympathy in high school or college. Maybe that was Diaz's point. Maybe not.\n\nCould it be that I'm just too old for this book? The Search for Snatch doesn't seem as metaphysical in my sixties as it did in my teens. I kept hoping that there was more to Oscar's dilemma than simple hormonal compulsion. But there wasn't. Let's hope Junot Diaz gets past this hoary obsession with his own testosterone and writes a masterpiece some day.\n\nPostscript: I've been thinking about this novel in light of the comments it drew from 'a customer.' Possibly I underappreciated the political/historical signifiers. Possibly Oscar is a bit allegorical, a synecdoche of the whole DR diaspora, living semi-lives in el Norte. Possibly Trujillo really is an immortal Dark Lord, reincarnating constantly in what one character means when he says \"we are ten million Trujillos.\" In other words, the novel may be open to deeper readings, if you can keep your eyes off the mammaries.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I found the voluminous footnotes and the slang, often in Spanish, particularly exasperating. Also, the not-always-identifiable narrator changes frequently and is sometimes first person, sometimes third, with lots of backtracking in time.

Yunior grows to genuinely care for Oscar, the bumbling obese nerd who pines for women he can't have.

Not the most easily empathized with character, to say the least.  But by the end, he and his family's history are totally sympathetic.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to read it, I picked it up again and became utterly enthralled with the story.  Somehow, it suddenly clicked and I was unable to put it down.  This is one of the BEST novels I have read in years.\n\nThe plot revolves around what is taken as a family curse, a circle of destruction and difficult survival.  There are mythical beings that appear, but it is not magical realism at all.  They are part of the imagery passed from one generation to the next is some mysterious way, appearing at crucial moments of danger.  Call it what you want:  a curse, destiny, psychology, genetic determinism, but all the characters conform to the circle, working it out in their own ways.\n\nThe history starts with a terrible tragedy in the Dominican Republic, the kind of thing that takes place under dictators.  It is so vivid that I found it painful to read, yet fascinating as several dear friends of mine from the past are Dominican. I learned a lot of history from the novel - where they came from and what their particular dictatorship was like.  From there, the survivors remain caught in history's web, either acting out the same pattern or consciously attempting to live a life that negates it.  Everyone that follows the tragedy is a bit player, perhaps escaping at the very end of the third generation.  I do not want to reveal anything here as a spoiler, but to give my interpretation.\n\nWhat makes the novel such a success is that you really believe in all the characters, see their motivations and limitations as real and inexorable, and understand the island's history (a universal story, really).  It is pathetic, sad, funny, and occasionally uplifting.  Genuinely a stunning performance, a real work of art.\n\nAn added treat is the experimental manner in which it is written:  peppered with SPanish words - I kept a dictionary on hand, not that it helped that much given how much dialect patois was in it - and full of allusions to scifi, comics, and role-play games.  (Being something of a nerd myself, I got about half of the references to Dune, Lord of the Rings, Marvel COmics, Octavia Butler, and Star Trek.)

I truly am a constant reader with sons, who probably has read more sci-fi and fantasy than most readers of this book (trust me, I am pretty good with LOTR, Star Trek, Star Wars, and most super heroes) and I could not get the full meaning of all of the references. (Oops, perhaps I should say the LOTR is Lord of the Rings, before I do the same thing.) My only conclusion is that our author did not care if we did.\nThe footnotes were self-indulgent and should not have made it past an editor. They were distracting and not appropriate here. Novels that are set in perilous political times are not unusual. His book and his Dominican history are no more important here and the reader is no more ignorant here. It is the author's job to assume ignorance and make his story work without footnotes. Take Mr. Pip, a brilliant work of fiction set in a time of real political crisis in a real south pacific island country. There were no footnotes. If you wanted to know more about the history, you went and looked it up. Everything you really needed to understand the people and care about them was on the page. The reader learned a lot about the conflict from its impact on the characters.\nThis novel switches narrators from time to time and the voices are poorly developed. The life situations surrounding these characters are very dramatic, but it is very difficult to care about any of them. The themes of home, displacement and alienation are powerful themes that are not developed. Oscar's death should be tragic, but I wasn't weeping.\nAs an aside, much of the book is in untranslated Spanish- mainly foul and rude language that was part of the characterization. No complaints here about the vulgarity since that was part of his story. But. Those of us who read the book in English with so much untranslated Spanish are clearly reading a different book from those who read the book in Spanish where I assume that the entire book was in the same language. Even when you got the gist of the Spanish, it was another level of distance placed between the reader and the characters. Perhaps, you say, that it just really could not be translated.

That is just one more way to say that we are just not capable of seeing those new clothes.\nMuch was made of his years of toil and the years of anticipation for this book, but the years do not show.

Coincidentally, he is the polar opposite of what Dominican man should be.  He can't dance and he hasn't had a real girlfriend since the age of seven, and consequently becomes infatuated with every girl he ever sees, desperate to find someone who will reciprocate his love.  His sister, Lola, is a bit of wild child.  She's had many boyfriends, ran away from home, and run with a bad crowd, although she has been trying to clean up her life.  Lola loves her brother Oscar more than anything else in the world.  They are the product of their upbringing by a mother who has led a difficult life herself.  Beli was orphaned at a young age and abused by distant relatives until being rescued by her father's cousin, who goes by the name La Inca.  La Inca, who feels great remorse over not helping her cousin when the dictatorship turned against him, tried her best with Beli, and later does everything in her power to help Lola and Oscar with their respective troubles.\n\nI have mixed feelings on this book.  I did like it for the most part, and I generally enjoyed reading it.  But then again, I enjoy at least some aspect of most books I read.  My biggest problem with the book concerned the writing.  There was a good deal of Spanish sprinkled throughout the text, which made me feel like I was missing a lot (due to my lack of knowledge of the Spanish language).  Additionally, I found from some friends who do know Spanish somewhat that what is written here is a dialect, making it hard even for them to understand.  Most of the book is written from the perspective of Yunior, a long-time friend (and former boyfriend) of Lola's, and Oscar's roommate for a while in college.  So a lot of it is told in kind of a ghetto-speak sort of manner, which was kinda fun and funky at some times but extremely off-putting at other times.  Since a lot of the story concerned events and people of the Trujillo regime, the author included a lot of footnotes to explain the history to those who didn't know much about it.  These were helpful, but some of them went on and on, and I got tempted to just skip over them.  It wasn't all bad though; there was a lot for me to enjoy in this book.  I did enjoy all the sci-fi and fantasy references; they actually were quite helpful for me in understanding some of the points the author was trying to make.  Oscar was overall a sweet character, and he reminded me of many people I've known throughout my life, nerdy guys who know that they could find acceptance if they'd just change their ways but are unwilling to compromise who they truly are.  There was a nice theme of love that didn't really make itself apparent until just at the end, when you see that if nothing else, Oscar had a deep impact on Yunior, who was inspired to become a writer himself and eventually settled down with a family.  I think that a good deal of meaning can be found in the last part of the book, but it might take a re-reading for me to understand it all.  Lastly, Junot Daz did a good job with the concept of Diaspora, which can be a hard subject to accurately articulate.  \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" was a good rendering of the lives of three generations of Dominicans, and even if I wasn't entirely satisfied with it, the story will stick with me for sometime to come.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Large portions of it are written in Spanish. There are also numerous other phrases and situations lifted from a number of sci-fi books, anime, manga, which form a language in and of themselves. You either need to know all of these worlds thoroughly to understand the book, or you need to have a \"cliff notes\" guide next to you and go back and forth between the book you're reading and the explanation of what the chapter actually meant.\n\nThe book is told from a number of points of view - Oscar, his sister Lola, his mother, even his grandmother and more. Each person tells a portion of the story from their own point of view and fills in more of the storyline. Oscar is an obese man of Dominican descent who takes refuge in a world of sci-fi and fantasy. He is picked on for his size and his depression and retreat make up the majority of this story. What makes up the other part is the history of the Dominican Republic. With many books you read the story and at the end all you've learned is about those fake characters and their lives. With this book, you really learn a lot about the Dominican Republic - something that most of us probably know nothing at all about. I give the book a lot of credit for all of the research and information it presents in a fun, enjoyable way. The use of footnotes to do it is a bit stilting at time, but it still is enriching to learn the history.\n\nI really did enjoy the book greatly - but I also took six years of Spanish. I could understand what it was saying. I think the average non-Spanish speaker who is reading along about Beli working in a restaurant and hitting the phrase, \"Oye, paraguayo, y que paso con esa esposa tuya? Gordo, no me digas que tu todavia tienes hambre?\" are going to be sort of lost. I could see if they tossed in one-word in context words such as \"Adios, see you later my friend!\" However, the book goes FAR beyond that and often you need to know what the words mean to understand what is going on. There really should have been footnotes with translations - there are certainly enough footnotes with less important things story-wise.\n\nIn the same way, you miss a lot of the storyline if you haven't read certain books. For example, Oscar often speaks in Dune-language. He says at one point his grandmother \"tried to use the Voice\" on him. This is a power of the Bene Gesserit in Dune, where they could subtly control someone's actions by speaking in a certain way to them. In another part he is afraid, and starts quoting \"Fear is the mind killer\" which is the Bene Gesserit \"Litany Against Fear\". The whole litany gives a mental environment for handling fear, which the reader is expected to know and understand.\n\nMore people might get the Lord of the Rings references which are scattered around quite a lot, given the recent popularity of those movies. One woman is \"ageless, the family's very own Galadriel,\" i.e. the Elven beauty from Lothlorien. Speaking of Lothlorien, another section of the book talks about how a woman \"who with the elvish ring of her will had forged within Bani her own personal Lothlorien, knew that she could not protect the girl against a direct assault from the Eye.\" There's a lot of Lord of the Rings mythology wrapped up in that sentence that a non-LOTR reader would miss. Even more meaningful, when Oscar first read Lord of the Rings he choked at the line \"and out of Far Harad black men like half-trolls\" which represents an entire area of sociological discussion about how Tolkien handled dark skinned people.\n\nThis type of situation is everywhere. There are lines from Akira. Commentary from Star Wars. Lots of quick one-line references that bring with them a wealth of meaning, but if you don't have that background of literature in your history, you will miss what he's trying to say. I was lucky in that I am a huge sci-fi buff and also love anime, so I got a lot of those references, but it really makes me wonder 1) what I still might have missed and 2) how much others who have not read all these things are going to miss. Again, the book really needs a CliffNotes to go with it, so you can see what all the references meant in the chapter you just finished.\n\nI didn't find any websites that do this type of breakdown, so maybe I should start one up! It really is needed, to get the full understanding of the plot and subtle meaning in what is being said.\n\nWell recommended if you have that Spanish language background and sci-fi fantasy understanding. If you go into this without understanding Spanish and not having read any sci-fi, you're going to run into a *lot* you are confused by. You can either just accept that is going to happen or have a web browser nearby to help you translate.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Seriously though, I've tried to read some Pulitzer winners that I abandoned rather quickly.  This book, on the other hand, is extremely engaging and captivating.\n\nIt is essentially the story of a family from the Dominican Republic, immigrated to Paterson, New Jersey.  It begins with the current second generation Americans and works its way backward to mid-20th century DR, focusing to a large extent on the political history of the Dominican Republic under Trujillo.  This history is largely relegated to extensive footnotes, a method that some apparently find objectionable, but that didn't bother me in the least.  In fact, I found the DR history lesson to be one of the strong suits of the novel.\n\nI had two issues with the novel, however, that should be noted.  The first is the EXTENSIVE use of Spanish throughout the novel.  This took two forms.  The first, and least problematic, were the frequent slang words sprinkled throughout the book.  Most of these were easily identifiable through context.  Who knew there were so many different Spanish slang terms for the female sexual organ?\n\nMore troublesome by far, were the entire Spanish sentences, many times very meaningful to the flow of the story that would suddenly appear, without translation or context.  I don't understand this.  This is a novel written in English for a largely English speaking audience, yet at key points in the story, very meaningful dialog is issued in Spanish.  It's almost as if the author is thumbing his nose at the reader.\n\nThe second issue which could impact a reader's enjoyment of the writing is the almost non-stop reference to fantasy and science fiction characters and story lines, most predominantly Lord of the Rings.  You see, Oscar was immersed in fantasy and science fiction literature and sees the world through that prism.  I'm not talking about having read Lord of the Rings in middle school.  I'm talking about deep Tolkien references.  If you are not familiar with the Witch King of Angmar, you may still enjoy the book, but will not grasp many of the references and subtleties.  Luckily, I recognized most of them.\n\nThis novel is at times painful to read.  It is a story that involves great cruelty and much suffering, but it is beautiful nonetheless.  If you are an avid reader, with a background in science fiction and fantasy and happen to be bilingual as well, this may be the most enjoyable book you have ever read.  My lack of Spanish fluency was an issue and caused me to teeter between four and five stars, but the story and writing were simply too good to fall below the highest rating.

I enjoyed it very much, however, I found it very difficult as well. I attribute this to the fact that I had the audio version for this Pulitzer-Prize winner. There was a lot of use of Spanglish, and for someone without a Spanish background this was tough. The story itself was wonderful.\n\nTold through the eyes of various narrators, readers enter the frightening world of a Dominican Republic family living in New Jersey. The characters' lives are overflowing with injustices, unrequited love, lost opportunities, physical cruelties, and as one narrator points out, an ancient Dominican curse called Fuk.\n\nOscar Wao, is a nice guy, who longs for love but he finds a lot of road blocks along the way: he's fat, a comic book, sci-fi, and fantasy nerd, and a loser. These undesirable characteristics diminish his chances of finding love. The love he so desperately craves, continues to elude him, and we witness the lengths Oscar is willing to endure just for the opportunity, however brief to feel love. Oscar is a poignant, painful, and lovable character who is in constant battle with his delusions. The female characters: Oscar's mother and sister, were very memorable as well. Their own brutal histories and sacrifices are heartbreaking.\n\nI highly recommend this luminous, and humorous book, however, I would recommend the print version as opposed to the audio version, simply because of the English/Spanish difficulty I had.", "Feedback": "positive"}

After Junot Diaz's collection of short stories was released some years ago, the eyes of the literary world waited, with much anticipation, for the results of his first full-length attempt.  By all accounts, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao did not disappoint and went on to win the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for long fiction.\n\nThis story of a 300-lb, D&D loving, fantasy-adventure writing, Dominican nerdboy is funny, tragic, pitiful and sweet all at the same time.  Told through the voices of those who know him best, it is a wonderfully fleshed-out account of a young man's life viewed from the many different angles and points that give us all our form, and never is it clearer than when driving home the point that no one of us is an island, and that no matter how we fight it, we are to some extent - more than most of us would probably like - products of our heritage, our upbringing, and the actions and words of those who love us - and, just as significantly or perhaps even more so, those who don't.\n\nThis book is all straight talk - nothing flowery here.  At times vulgar and crass, even a little shocking, it might make your eyes widen a few times, but at least it's with feeling.  I particularly enjoyed the viewpoint given by Lola, Oscar's sister, as she rages with her dying mother, who is no less a controlling tyrant even when facing death.  If I were to express one wish to Mr. Diaz, it would be to write a companion novel just about Lola.\n\nI don't think I've ever before read a novel where the subject matter varies so widely and vividly, from Oscar's obsession with the fantasy genre to the brutal reign of Rafael Trujillo, the former president of the Dominican Republic.  You might wonder how on earth these two subjects could meet in one book, but they do, and in a way that makes you see how inseparable they really are.  The past figures so prevalently in the present - and the future, one presumes - that it can't be ignored or glossed over.\n\nMany, like me, have puzzled over the name.  Oscar Wao?  Is he Asian?  I thought he was Dominican?  Does he have an Asian father?  Well, that question too is answered about halfway through, and like every other circumstance surrounding Oscar's life, it's both funny and a little sad, and not even close to what you probably think it is!\n\nA good and thought-provoking read, in my opinion.

It is one of the most original and refreshing novels that I've read in recent memory.  Diaz's voice is distinctive, he takes risks and creates wonderfully entertaining and vivid characters.\n\nThe reasons I felt this didn't merit five stars and \"classic\" status are:\n\n  (1) I thought the last 10% of the book was disappointing and paled in comparison with the brilliance of the other 90% of the book.  Diaz could have done a lot better with Oscar's demise and for me the plot line he took didn't resonate.\n\n  (2) More Oscar.  The title and the opening of the book create a sense of desire and expectation for more of Oscar.  I don't want to suggest that the other parts of the novel that focused on Oscar's sister Lola, and her boyfriend Yunior, his mother and other characters were not really strong and keep me entertained.  Far from it, the parts of the book that focused on these characters added such dimension to the story.  However, I wanted more of Oscar.  I would have been content if Diaz expanded the scale of this novel and would have gladly read another 200 pages about Oscar.  It seems that Diaz wanted to avoid an \"epic\" family saga and in doing so, I think he short-changed Oscar.\n\nI don't speak Spanish and was not bothered by Diaz's frequent use of Spanish.  I probably would have appreciated these little bits of dialogue and description quite a bit.  However, I can't find criticism with Diaz for utilizing this mechanism within his novel.\n\nOverall, \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" is a must read.  It certainly is one of the most original \"American\" novels you'll read.  It wanted to be a classic and certainly had the ambition and scope to be.  In my mind, it just came up a little bit short.

In this novel the American experience is incidental, the focus is on the ghosts of the former life.\n\nThe writing is raw and replete with Spanish phrases/words that you can use a dictionary to decode or glean the meaning from the text.  I had trouble determining the voice, and an Amazon review set me straight as to who is narrating the chapters.\n\nThe narrators believe that a curse, the \"fuku\" shapes the family's destiny.  Flipping back and forth in time, the story provides a more rational foundation for the family's troubles. The insecurity of childhood and peer rejection play a big role in emotions and hence the fates of both Oscar and his mother.  Both love deeply and risk a lot through their loyality.  Both expect that their love should be reciprocated which leads to parallel trauma for the mother and son. Perhaps if they had had knowledge of their grandfather and father respectively, they would be more realistic.\n\nBesides illustrating a contemporary immigrant experience, the book provides a history lesson on the Dominican Republic.  One learns how the Trijillo dictatorship affected the lives of the people and bred the societal instability that followed it.\n\nThroughout, the book seems real.  The writing is spare, but clearly conveys the characters, their worlds and their choices.\n\nI don't think that the word \"wonderous\" in the title or the childlike red silouhette (albeit blood splattered) on the cover accurately convey the reality inside the cover.", "Feedback": "positive"}

My review is meant to augment his and provide some ancillary information (and opinions).\n\nJunot Diaz was born in the Dominican Republic in 1968. He moved to NJ when he was six-years old. He spent his teenage years in Old Bridge and Perth Amboy. He got his undergraduate degree from Rutgers and his graduate degree from Cornell. He is currently teaching creative writing at MIT. He won the Pulitzer Prize for this novel in April, 2008. He released a note that stated his shock and appreciation for the award, and then he went on to rhapsodize about how thrilled he was to win the award in the same year that Bob Dylan was given an honorary Pulitzer.\n\nFor the naysayers and the censors: Mr. Diaz uses curses, describes sexual situations (from both the male and female point of view), depicts violence, and he doesn't use standard punctuation. If these are things that traditionally bother you, then you should avoid this book.\n\nDiaz makes a great many allusions to The Lord of the Rings, the Marvel & DC Universes, game mechanics from Dungeons & Dragons and the Rutgers New Brunswick campus. If you are familiar with one or more of these, you'll find the book even more rewarding (if you were born between 1965 and 1985 and have a few nerdy qualities, this book is definitely for you).\n\nOscar is an anti-hero that is both endearing and entertaining.

And, from his atrocities come numerous De Leon family tragedies - grandfather, grandmother, two aunts, mother, and ultimately - but more distantly - Oscar.\n\nCommencing this reading, I stood no differently than my American counterpart: I knew nothing about Dominican history. As Diaz tells us in his first footnote, \"For those who missed your mandatory two seconds of Dominican history,: Trujillo . . . ruled the Dominican Republic between 1930 and 1961 with an implacable ruthless brutality.\" Not too much later, we discern he is a mini-Hitler with a latin libido.  The chortling chubby, and grotesquely ambivalent to human emotion dictator apparently jumps on the island's best  muchachas bones as they enter puberty. No exceptions to this rule. And, that creates much of the trouble of the \"family.\"\n\nDrowning in poverty and fuk-laden travails [the word fuk will be described below], the De Leon family watches the youngest, the simplest, the nicest of the clan also become a victim to fuk's character-scarring torture. Oscar, beholden to all that is good, smiles even though the curse is aimed directly at he and his spirit. And, as the fuk obliterates, his sister opines,\" . .  Ten Million Trujillos is all we are.\"\n\nDiaz tells this story like any expatriate from the Dominican may. Weaving his Spanish with English, and weaving each with classic use wand their naturally evolved slang, this book resonates of authentic Dominican flare. Trujillo is called many uncomplimentary things on the book's many pages - sometimes in English and sometimes in Spanish.  Anectdotal sayings abound in this book - often in Spanish, often in Dominican pejorative patois, and often in English.\n\nSome reviewers, I noticed, dislike the book's plentiful usage of Spanish. Feeling lost, they are understandably frustrated. Being a Miamian, I understand most of the street language.  Note, my knowledge is minimal.  This is not high class or deeply unique usage of foreign language. Fowles use of French in \"The Magus\",  Joyce's use of Latin in \"Portrait of a Young Man as an Artist\" or so many of the Oxford-educated writers' reliance on French and Latin actually can be interpreted as more cumbersome, more difficult to discern. And, to be compared to those writers tells most anyone that this is one very talented writer of the 21st century who should not be ignored.\n\nSometimes, foreign words' homonymic relationship to our own can lead to deceiving and deceitful connotations.  In this book, curse is translated as a fuk.  Of course, if you mumbled the same in English, it would not mean a curse, but would be interpreted as a spoken curse.  Cute portmanteau. Sometimes, jumping in and out of the languages creates a unique rhythm.  This book has its own rhythm, one not experienced in either language alone. That is part of the magic. That is part of the charm.\n\nThis is, in many respects, a cacophony of latin sounds blending with English language over an entirely Caribbean topic.  You can almost taste the food, hear the speakers, smell the ocean and barrios, dance to the congas, and be lured by the colorful attire suffused against the tan or even black flesh.

A character that becomes bigger than his book, that transcends narrative and becomes a human being. Early in the novel he is described as `not one of those Dominican cats everybody's always going on about - he wasn't no home-run hitter or a fly bachatero, not a playboy with a million hots on his jock'.

And he may suffer from an ancient curse called fuk that has fallen upon his family for centuries.\n\nIn order to tell Oscar's familiar history, Daz uses this curse as both a device and an excuse. The whole narrative maybe focused on the journey of fuk until it reaches the protagonist. As such, \"The brief wondrous life of Oscar Wao\" becomes a bigger picture.

Using a mixture of Spanish, Dominican slang, and sci-fi/comic book references, Diaz brings home the head-spinning reality of the immigrant experience, where one often knows that they are missing much of what transpires around them, as details of context and colloquialism are lost.  While this makes the read on occasion difficult (while I am nerdy enough to be ok on the comics and sci-fi, I often needed to ask my Spanish speaking wife for help), he makes his point with skill.  At the same time the book is laced with humor and the pathos.\n\nDiaz also gives the reader a great deal about the Dominican Republic and the sort of seething anger which surely grows out of being from a small country that is at once under the thumb of a superpower, yet about which the people of the aforementioned superpower are almost entirely ignorant.  Again, he accomplishes this in a way that, supported by the strong cables of his sense of humor, never descends to preaching.  His characters continue to be interesting throughout, even as we can pretty much guess from the title where the book is heading.\n\nIf there is one draw back to the book, it is Diaz's occasional failures of narration.

{"ReviewerID": "A1RAUVCWYHTQI4", "ProductID": "B000UZJRGI", "Review": "A Family's History of the Dominican Republic I loved Diaz's short story collection Drown, and like almost everyone else who read it, have been eagerly waiting years for his next book. Now, something like a decade later, Diaz brings a character from that collection (Yunior) back to narrate the family history of his Rutgers roommate Oscar (who is also the brother of Yunior's sometime girlfriend). This tale begins with Oscar's grandfather and ends up encompassing quite a bit of the modern history of the Dominican Republic. And although the story hopscotches back and forth in time and location quite a bit, Diaz has complete command of his narrative.\n\nTo be fair, sometimes the story feels more like \"A People's History of the Dominican Republic.\" than a novel about a geeky kid from New Jersey. Not that this is a bad thing -- Diaz manages to get at the political, economic, and psychological forces that brought so many Dominican immigrants to the U.S . over the last fifty years via captivating and dextrous prose. The dominant theme of this multigenerational story is the \"fuku\" (curse) Oscar's family lives under. (Of course, as Yunior points out, every Dominican family believes itself to be cursed by the fuku americanus, a curse brought by European colonialists which has turned the Caribbean Eden into a despotic prison to be escaped.)s The fuku first hits Oscar's grandfather, an upper-class doctor undone by the rise of the Trujillo thugocracy (equal to that of Saddam Hussein in horror inflicted on its subjects). His daughter (Oscar's mother) faces her own tragedy due to the fuku, and is the bridge between life in the D.R. and life in America, as she escapes to New York. Her children, Oscar and Lola, represent the generation born and bred in the U.S. -- both connected to, and apart from their Dominican heritage.\n\nThe story thus enables Diaz to examine how nationality, culture, and language become more and more blended over generations (non-Spanish speakers should note that the book is full of untranslated Spanish words and phrases, which can be a little frustrating at times). The segments of the book set in the D.R. under the Trujillo regime tend to be a great deal more compelling than the contemporary storyline. The story of Oscar's mother's childhood and teen years are far more colorful and dramatic than the on-again, off-again romance between Yunior and Oscar's sister Lola, and are definitely more interesting than Oscar's own geeky problems. Fat, obsessive, and devoid of social skills, Oscar makes it hard for people (including the reader) to sympathize with him and his dual dreams of becoming the \"Dominican Tolkein\" and losing his virginity. The final section of the book, in which Oscar pursues love with the trademark oblivious obsession that has made him an outcast, is pretty much straightforward classical doomed love, and thus the least interesting and convincing.\n\nThe overall effect of the book is a good deal more sad and depressing than I had expected. Although the title and opening chapter alert the reader to the brevity of Oscar's life, for some reason, I hadn't expected it to unfold quite as pathetically and tragically as it does. Similar tragedies unfold in the previous generations, and by the end of the book, there is little consolation of any kind to be found. Diaz writes with so much compassion for his characters that one would be hard pressed not to be affected. However, the sexual themes that pervade all the storylines act as somewhat of a life-affirming counterbalance to all the death and disappointment. And above all, there is the sheer exuberance and dexterity of the prose, which makes the book well worth reading from a purely stylistic or technical perspective. Not exactly a masterpiece, but well worth reading.", "Feedback": "positive"}

A family curse, a tropical island, a love-stricken underdog, a kind and beautiful woman with a torrid past: it sounds like the setup for a typical romance novel. But while Junot Diaz's long-awaited THE BRIEF WONDROUS LIFE OF OSCAR WAO is romantic in its own way, this book is anything but typical.\n\nThere may be a fuk, a curse, on the De Leon family; it sure seems that Oscar de Leon is living under one. Nerdy, overweight and socially awkward, Oscar lives with his fierce mother Belicia and his smart and lovely sister Lola. Unlike all the other Dominican men he knows, Oscar has no game with women. He falls in love again and again, but girls who aren't repelled by him see him only as a friend and someone to confide in about their own love lives.\n\nAs Oscar's lonely tale unfolds, readers are taken back two generations to when his family lived in the Dominican Republic under the violent dictator Trujillo. Oscar's grandfather, Abelard, spends the last years of his life as a broken and literally tortured man in prison for not turning over his daughter to Trujillo. Abelard's third daughter, Belicia, is born after his imprisonment and soon sold into virtual slavery. She is eventually tracked down by her father's cousin, a wise widow called La Inca. La Inca finds Belicia defiant after years of abuse, and she soon grows into a gorgeous young woman. The two do their best under the oppressive government and are even prospering until Belicia falls in love with a powerful gangster and gets pregnant. Belicia's dreams of love are shattered, and so is her body, as the gangster's goons beat her to the edge of death and leave her in a cane field. Angry and mourning the loss of her unborn baby, Belicia leaves the Dominican Republic, taking the fuk with her.\n\nYears later, as a grown man back in the Dominican Republic and in love with La Inca's neighbor, Oscar feels the full weight of the fuk. But will his final act of love break the family from the curse's power? Will his future niece, Lola's daughter, be spared the sorrow and pain of the fuk? Either way, Oscar risks it all to love and to finally feel love in return.\n\nDiaz's novel is sassy and wise, sharp and poignant. Oscar is a charming loser and his story is both heart-wrenching and hilarious. The three main female characters --- Belicia, Lola and La Inca --- are strong and passionate, and while Oscar falls for interesting women, they pale in comparison to the three he grew up with. There are compelling male characters also, not in the least the narrator who knows Oscar and his family well.\n\nDiaz writes in a natural vernacular, freely using Spanish and Dominican slang without translation or apology. It is only occasionally distracting (if you don't know Spanish) but still the story flows well and his meaning is always clear. He also explores much Dominican history and culture (often employing the footnotes so popular in fiction right now) firmly setting Oscar's life in the Dominican diaspora.\n\nOSCAR WAO is full of sci-fi and fantasy references, especially Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Diaz explains Oscar's life the way Oscar would, full of clever puns and illusions to the one ring and Mordor. However, the narrator has a distinct voice of his own --- a street dialect both crass and keen.\n\nDiaz's novel is fun and serious, broad in scope yet intimate. This unique and delightful tale is highly recommended.\n\n  --- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman", "Feedback": "positive"}

Just be a smart bookish boy of color in a contemporary U.S. ghetto.  Mamma mia!  Like having bat wings or a pair of tentacles growing out of your chest.\"\n\nMeet Oscar de Le&oacute;n.  Once upon a time, in elementary school, Oscar was a slick Dominican kid who seemed to have a typical life ahead of him.  Then, around the time he hit puberty, Oscar gained a whole lot of weight, became awkward both physically and socially, and got deeply interested in things that made him an outcast among his peers (sci-fi novels, comics, Dungeons & Dragons, writing novels, etc.).  A particularly unfortunate Dr. Who Halloween costume earns him the nickname Oscar Wao for the costume's resemblance to another Oscar: playwright Oscar Wilde (Wao being a Dominican spin on the surname).  His few friends are embarrassed by him, girls want nothing to do with him, and everywhere he goes Oscar finds nothing but derision and hostility.  And he's not the only person in his family suffering through life: his mother, a former beauty, has been ravaged by illness, bad love affairs, and worry regarding her two children; and his sister Lola, another intense beauty, has been cursed with a nomadic soul and her mother's poor taste in men.\n\nThe kicker about the de Le&oacute;n family?  They just may be the victims of a bona fide curse (a particularly nasty one at that, called a fuk&uacute;) as a result of their history with Rafael Trujillo, a former dictator of the Dominican Republic renowned for his brutality, and whose enemies uniformly met with disastrous ends one way or another (historical details about Trujillo and the history of his reign are scattered throughout the novel, a tidbit that may turn some off of the book, but rest assured that D&iacute;az is so utterly entertaining a writer that they are a joy to read).  The de Le&oacute;ns are on a collision course with disaster, but can they break the curse before it's too late?\n\n\"you can never run away.  Not ever.  The only way out is in.\"\n\nEmbroiled in all this mess is Yunior, our primary narrator and Oscar's former college roommate (not to mention the philandering ex-boyfriend of Lola, the novel's other narrator), whose experiences with the de Le&oacute;n clan will haunt him for the rest of his life.  His attempts to help Oscar become more popular fail, as do his tries to escape Oscar's grasp.  \"These days,\" he remarks at one point, \"I have to ask myself: What made me angrier?  That Oscar, the fat loser, quit, or that Oscar, the fat loser, defied me?  And I wonder: What hurt him more?  That I was never really his friend, or that I pretended to be?\"\n\nOscar is far and away the most poignant character to come along in a great long while; in my book he's every bit as memorable as Ignatius J. Reilly, Holden Caulfield, Randall Patrick McMurphy, and other literary giants.  Furthermore, \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" is a phenomenal novel that is hysterical, hypnotic, heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal parts (and quite often at the same time).  The plot is a madcap high-wire act balanced with astonishing dexterity by Junot D&iacute;az.  If he has a misstep it is in the denouement, which is rather sudden and slightly lacking in clarity for an otherwise thorough novel.  Nonetheless, I loved, loved, loved this book.

My review is twofold;  first a few comments on the author and then a few more on the negative ratings some readers have posted.\n\nFirst;  Bravo to Lynne McTaggart!  In a world that is overwhelmed with opposing views, black vs. white, conservative vs. progressive, science vs. religion, we have a reporter who not only realized that there is a middle ground that lies unfurrowed between science and religion but a person who took years from her life doing the necessary research and self-education in order to help define what this area is.  Her book is well foot-noted and while her scientific language usage has developed past that of common understanding, she defines this middle ground with well thought out examples and the concise language that it deserves.  I, likewise, have spent the past thirty years of my life attempting to comingle science and spirituality and this book has served as an excellent summary for the travails I have undergone.\n\nSecondly;  The only people who do not make mistakes in this lifetime are the ones who willing to do nothing more than repeat their past victories over and over again.  Those who dare to probe into unknown territories, peek into truisms to see if they are valid and risk being labeled as being eccentric in their theories and concepts are the only ones who will actually make mistakes.  But they, too, are the only ones that will make incredible breakthroughs that move our world in a forward, evolutionary fashion by their courageous insights and daring.  The reviewers who have degraded this author for her taking questionable experiments and off-the-wall scientists are the ones who are stuck in yesterdays science and are only willing to accept thoughts that have proven themselves over the decades.  While science, during the Enlightenment Era, had been able to move the world slowly away from religious dogma, they now are creating the same ignorant and immovable atmosphere that they originally found themselves into.  They, in fact, have their own set of dogmas, their own set of beliefs that cannot be questioned and have created an atmosphere that there is no reality that exists outside of the small sphere that they have defined.  We live in a world that is not at all the manner that we see it to be nor in a world where we are fully knowledgeable.  We live in an atmosphere where we are trying to measure eleven dimensional space with primitive three dimensional objects.  We live in a world wherewe ponder, but never truly grasp, the simple definition of the words consciousness nor that which is eternal.  No, dogmatic scientists do not meet weekly for Sunday service.  Instead they simply control the reputation of their colleagues, the purse strings for experimentation and the publication power for future writings that prevents new and unique concepts of reality from receiving the attention they deserve.

{"ReviewerID": "A3RFXU3P0XKKF4", "ProductID": "B000V507D4", "Review": "The Field of all Fields (Written in London)\n\nThis book is about \"the secret force\" of the universe, and this is no kidding. It is about the concept \"field,\" a mathematical abstraction used by mathematicians to represent a medium or region of influence for connecting points in space via lines of force -- a concept that is already familiar to most scientists. The \"electromagnetic force field\" is the one most familiar to us and is the perfect example of a field put to daily use. However, the idea of a \"field\" easily can be expanded to other areas and to other forces. In the present context the force in question is energy, and the field in question is the zero point energy field (ZPF).\n\nHere in an impressive intellectual journey. We have a superb journalist rather than a scientist taking us on a scientific trip across a new kind of field. It is a journey that is so profound that even the most seasoned scientists would envy the sights seen along the way. Drawing on all of her skills of observation, as well as her impressive innate interpretative skills, and using the concept of a zero point energy field, she pulls us along \"kicking and screaming all the way\" to the very frontiers of contemporary particle physics and science itself.\n\nStarting with all of the familiar but more perplexing anomalies quantum physics has bedazzled us with over the last two generations, including the commonly recognized fact that there is no longer such a thing as a \"vacuum\" -- since it is now well known that virtual particles are constantly exchanging energy in such a way that their resultant energy levels \"only appear to be zero\" -- Ms. McTaggart introduces a concept that many scientists will readily recognize as a very weighty and scientifically stubborn one: the idea of a Zero Point Field (ZPF).\n\nWhat contemporary scientists will not acknowledge is how, by using the ZPF as a veritable wrecking ball, a handful of maverick scientists have been able to single-handedly tear down the wall of anomalies that quantum physics has built around contemporary scientific and philosophical knowledge? That is why the first half of this book is a tour de force. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the second half, which arguably attempts to stretch the concepts in part I beyond their breaking point. But I have reserved comments on this aspect for the last two paragraphs of this review.\n\nTo get right to the best part of the book, the first half, the reader may recall that one of the many consequences of \"Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\" is that no particle ever stays completely at rest, but remains in constant motion due to a ground state background field of energy in which the universe is constantly interacting with all subatomic matter. We now know that the field that defines this activity (and it is the only field that remains active even at a temperature of \"absolute zero\") is called the \"Zero Point Field.\" The ultimate epistemological meaning of this most fundamental of scientific concepts is that it more accurately defines the basic background structure of empty space in our universe. That structure is not, as was once thought a vacuum, but instead is a sea of quantum fields all in constant interaction with each other: To wit, a sea of virtual activity that cannot be eliminated by any presently known laws of physics (including at absolute zero!).\n\nAt bottom then, from the background noise (or Plank) level upwards, and from a temperature of absolute zero upwards, our universe is alive and well, literally teeming in a sea of foaming light and energy. It is no secret that at this baseline of irreducible activity, the mediating or connecting force is \"exchanges of energy\" between particles. Again from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, we know that it is impossible to know all the properties of a particle at the same time (position and momentum for instance). Despite this, we DO know that no matter what other fields are involved, that since every exchange of every virtual particle radiates lines of energy (as waves on a sea of activity), the Zero Point (energy) Field becomes the ultimate field of fields.\n\nAnd here is a key point that McTaggart brings out into the open here: We also know that due in large part to their sinusoidal character, one of the important aspects of waves is that they are encoders and carriers of information. Or said more exactly, because of the inherent wave like fluctuations in nature, we know that we can track them through interference patterns and and through the elementary mathematics of their Fourier transforms. As a result, the quantum interactions of the ZPF, the field of fields, become a natural repository of information -- information whether as waves or as discrete particles that can serve as a kind of bookkeeping device of last resort for the entire universe. One that can allow us to keep track of all fields, all ground energy states and all virtual particles, for all times.\n\nIn short, the ZPF allows us to literally be able to read the energy (sea) waves of the universe. This is quite a bit of heavy-lifting for one field and one concept to prove itself capable of.\n\nNow here comes the hard part. The author's overarching hypothesis is that the very existence of the energy exchanges occurring at the ZPF (the wave-based sea of background noise of the universe) implies that all matter in the universe is connected by energy exchanges (as ZPF energy waves) that contain a kind of information (via Fourier Transforms for instance) that can be \"read back\" to us as they spread out across time and space to infinity.\n\nShe argues convincingly in my view that it is these \"readable\" waves of the resultant ZPF that ultimately tie one part of the universe to every other part of the universe. And does so for all times! Its too bad that this dauntingly beautiful, seductive and ultimately ambitious hypothesis may only be true but in a completely trivial sense? That is to say, it may be true only at the Plank level of activity?\n\nAnd while this is another story, it is far from the end of the story, nor even half of it in fact. Following the trail of several maverick Scientists who also have adopted this hypothesis as their own, the author concludes that by simply taking properly into account the ZPF and the wealth of information that it conveys, a number of long-standing dilemmas (so called anomalies) in both particle and quantum physics indeed may finally be solved. And if at this point the reader has not already been convinced that this is heady stuff, then perhaps following-up on her string of astounding resolved examples will finally seal the deal. Since her explanations get lengthy, the first of them must suffice for this review.\n\nResolving the Bohr Electron Dilemma via the ZPF\n\nOne of the most famous and perhaps the most representative of the dilemma's facing quantum physicists is that faced by the father of the structure of the atom, Niels Bohr. After utterly failing to fully understand why electrons in the nucleus of atoms remain in stable orbits as he had posited (rather than either petering out of energy, or simply flying off into space), Bohr, proceeding only on intuition, somehow managed to \"intuit\" his way to the right answer: that an energy difference was \"involved\" and thus \"must have been\" the mechanism responsible for the electron's balance and stability?\n\nOnly recently, through the careful work of the three maverick scientists tracked here by the author, have we been able to show mathematically that Bohr's intuition was correct: that electrons gain and lose energy constantly by exchanges and transfers from the ZPF in a dynamic equilibrium: balanced at exactly the right orbit. In fact their findings went much further even than this. By inference they were also able to establish that the ZPF not only accounts for the stability of electrons in the atom, but also for the stability of all matter! And conversely, their equations also showed that by pulling the plug on the ZPF atomic structures also collapsed. And even more astounding yet, their calculations also showed that ZPF waves drive the motion of subatomic particles; and that all the motion of all the particles of the universe in turn generates the ZPF! QED.\n\nBut this is not the end of the story either, for if all subatomic matter in the world is interacting constantly with the ambient ground-state energy field (i.e., the ZPF), the subatomic waves of the field are constantly imprinting a record of the shape of everything. And as the imprinter of last resort of all wave lengths and all frequencies, the ZPF then becomes a kind of shadow of the universe for all time, a mirror image and record of everything that ever was. In a sense, this \"once thought to be vacuum\" of interactive activity,  actually becomes the beginning and the end of everything? And these maverick scientists have essentially proven that the universe itself is a kind of self-generating ZPF feedback loop ranging across the cosmos. [Excuse me, but that is a mouthful by any stretch of the imagination.]\n\nIn the same way that they solved Bohr's dilemma, by using the ZPF and mathematics, without introducing renormalization, running into matrices of infinities, and adding or subtracting other strange fudge factors, such as adding in mysterious universal constants, etc., these authors were able to resolve each of quantum physics' most bedeviling anomalies: such as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, wave-particle duality, non-locality, the fluctuating motion of particles, and the most perplexing of all, explaining where gravity comes from. And they have done this carefully, with the use of mathematics and the ZPF.\n\nYet, reception within the scientific community of these astounding findings has been luke-warm to muted, at best. Part of the reason may be due to the only aspect of the author's interpretation of their analyses that I found wanting: beyond the quantum level, the effects of the ZPF appear to be infinitesimally small to the point of being vanishingly negligible? And thus, to put it mildly, the ZPF solutions, while mathematically accurate, elegant and interesting, frankly appear to be physically not very robust?\n\nSecond, in the last half of the book where ESP experiments are introduced, it must be said that the quality of the science begins to slip back into the danger zone, even to the noise level. Most of the experiments in this section follows the well-hewn contours of  \"near science\" of testimonials and singular non-peer reviewed reports instead of what I would call \"real science.\" These are techniques practiced by those who are just a bit too anxious to make the necessary connections between \"real science\" and \"near-science.\" Had the author allowed the science of those experiments to speak for themselves as was the case in the first half of the book, this would have been a world-class production.\n\nBut even in the first instance, there are still non-trivial concerns to worry about. For instance, in order to resolve most quantum anomalies through \"real science,\" solutions are required not just in theory, or through mathematical equations, but also at the level of large-scale effects; not just at the background level or Planck level of quantum only effects.\n\nAs but one example, suppose that it is indeed true that non-locality can be proven at the Plank or quantum level of interaction. If at all other levels these non-local effects diminish with the square of the distance between particles as they do under the Newtonian assumptions, then \"interaction-at-a-distance\" only at the non-quantum level is a rather moot point, and its effects remain essentially as we have known them to be in the Newtonian and Einstein universes.\n\nThat this might indeed prove to be the case does not bother me in the least. However, if the concept of \"interaction-at-a-distance\" is to be a robust idea, then the interactive effects must be observable not just at the ZPF, or Planck level, but also must be robust above the noise level. Otherwise one could easily argue that the author's demonstration of \"interaction-at-a-distance\" reduces to so much trivia.\n\nI believe that with such a serious first half of a book, the author did herself a disservice to have \"cut-corners\" to make shallow points with \"near science\" in the second half of the book.

The accounts are those given by the scientists themselves - a point that some of the critical reviewers seem to have overlooked when they dismiss this book as `unscientific nonsense' or science fiction. Lynne McTaggart is simply reporting in as accessible a way as possible what she has been told or what has been published by physicists, psychologists and physicians. This book is about the zero point field (zpf) - the residual (potential) energy field that remains in all matter at the absolute zero of temperature. The subatomic particles of matter interact with the zpf in every moment of their existence.\n\nConcepts from quantum physics are not easy to comprehend, especially if the reader doesn't have some background in science. Furthermore, these ideas present a different world view from that of Descartes and Newton, and there are many scientists (and some reviewers obviously!) who are stuck in this classical reductionist, materialist world-view and who refuse to accept that there is evidence of phenomena that simply cannot be explained with these principles. I am a scientist who has used quantum concepts in my research, and I do not `belong' to any religion: so I have no preconceived beliefs to distort my assessment of the facts. The personal stories that McTaggart tells here are not irrelevant, as one reviewer suggested - they put a human face to scientists who are thought by many to be without emotions because their work must necessarily be objective.\n\nPart 1 of the book, The Resonating Universe, explains the basic physics and describes how it extends classical ideas. For example, McTaggart describes how Haisch, Rueda and Putoff used the zpf to explain mathematically the inertia of matter, a concept derived from Newton's first law of motion. The `resonance' of the section title includes description of the coherence of photons (`light' or electromagnetic radiation) emitted from living tissue under certain conditions - evidence validated by German biophysicist Fritz-Albert Popp and others but dismissed by one biologist reviewer. Physicist Herbert Frhlich suggested similar resonance between proteins in the metabolism of cell tissues: this occurs only at what are now called Frhlich frequencies.\n\nIn Part 2, The Extended Mind describes the mind-body interactions that have become widely recognized now in medicine as crucial to our state of health. There are many books giving clinical examples, like those of Benson and Dossey. This interactive consciousness is postulated as occurring, at least partly, through the zpf.\n\nThis idea is elaborated further in Part 3, Tapping Into The Field, but extended into how we can through mind enter into Jung's collective unconscious (another name for the zpf?) and thereby affect other minds at other times and places besides the present. That this provides an explanation of psychic events is a hypothesis, as is the suggestion that the zpf is the cosmic spiritual energy that has been envisaged by mystical sages since earliest times. But the existence of the zpf itself is an established fact of quantum physics. Just how many natural phenomena result from its influence remains to be seen. This is one of the best books I have read on this challenging subject.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-New-Science-of-Life-The-Hypothesis-of-Morphic-Resonance-by-Rupert-Sheldrake/dp/0892815353/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance by Rupert Sheldrake</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Science-and-the-Akashic-Field-An-Integral-Theory-of-Everything-by-Irvin-Laszlo/dp/1594771812/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything by Irvin Laszlo</a>\n\nHoward Jones is the author of The World as Spirit", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2X4AEWNWCA1NX", "ProductID": "B000VDUWMC", "Review": "The only persuasive explanation for the wealth gap between the West and the rest Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nWhy is economic development so uneven around the world?\n\nDiamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? [W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? [W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel? In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a unified synthesisa unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.\n\nAcademic critics howled\n\nHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel:\n\n  They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Thats nitpicking, as far as Im concerned. And many of these errors could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories.\n\n  Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamonds book, its insulting to the reader.\n\n  The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of environmental determinism. Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factorsbut he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything weve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined.\n\n  There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didnt) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamonds critics never read the book.\n\n  However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, thats no error. He didn't pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.\n\nIs it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadnt cited their own specialized research?\n\nThe roots of academic criticism\n\nThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamonds expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. Its not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as not serious. And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.\n\nA wealth of meaning behind the title\n\nTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, its useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. The immediate reasons for Pizarros success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.\n\nDiamonds argument in a nutshell\n\nIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?' To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. Its unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the civilization in which we live.\n\nDiamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africaand the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United Statesimpeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the guns, germs, and steel that made Eurasian dominance possibleand dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.\n\nGuns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesnt make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, youll find this book highly rewarding.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Essentially, Diamond presents a world view of history that attempts to explain why there are such huge discrepancies between Eurasian cultures and other aboriginal cultures. For example, he bases his theory on the simple idea that history occurred as it did not because some races or civilizations were superior to others but that they were instead victims of geography. I have to agree with his theory. I do not, however, agree with his timelines - that tens of thousands of years took place throughout the dispersion of humanity around the globe. But then, Diamond is an evolutionary bio9logist, which explains his particular slant on time and progress.\n\nDiamond got started on this theory when a Papua New Guinea native asked him why the white European races had such advantages over peoples like himself, and why they acquired so much \"cargo\" in their cultures. As an example, Diamond points out that the Incas were captured by a handful of Spanish conquistadors, in spite of their intelligent civilization. He continues to explain his theory, in which factors such as food production, animal domestication, and differences in germs and technology cause the balance of power against a lot of aboriginal societies.\n\nDiamond contends (correctly, in my opinion) that peoples like the Papuans are not less intelligent in any way, biologically or intellectually, but are caught in a part of the world where no domestic plants, animals (including beasts of burden) and improvements in life styles do not occur. V concludes (again correctly, I believe) that the main instigator of advanced civilization is domestic progress in food production, which results in the dedication of higher learning, politics, and armed defense/offence. These advantages are established simply because certain areas of the world are naturally acclimated towards this sort of improvement and success. The Fertile Crescent, east Asia, and Mexico were good examples.\n\nIt all makes perfectly good sense to me. I never did agree with the suggested superiority of one race or ethnic group over another. It is interesting that Diamond, who believes in the farce of Evolution, would believe (correctly) that all humankind has the same innate ability to progress, if only given a fair opportunity in natural surroundings. This intriguing book is worth reading for that perspective, if you are willing to set aside evolutionary slants. I cannot believe, for instance, that aboriginal wanderers into North America would take as long as a million years to migrate from that Fertile Crescent into southeast Asia, or even two thousand years to get from northern Alaska to southern South America, as most demographers maintain.\n\nAs for the human race being possible seven million years old, it is too far a stretch of the imagination to consider, especially as this otherwise decent theory stems from a man who believes all human societies have the same survival and learning abilities.

{"ReviewerID": "AKQM58BHRSXC7", "ProductID": "B000VDUWMC", "Review": "The Evolution of Societies Over the years I have read many books on science and/or history, some good, some not so good.  GG&S ranks a one of the best and, for me, is a true classic.  The author, Jared Diamond, is a first class writer and his text is extremely easy to follow even though he covers some highly complex concepts.  As in his other books, Diamond's style is like taking a class in anthropology or sociology, only with out the mid-term finals.  GG&S was a best seller and winner of many awards for science books; Aventis, Phi Beta Kappa and Pulitzer.  All this attention did not prevent it from being controversial and, to this day, subject to intense debate among his peers in the scientific community.  In GG&S you will read one mans interpretation and conclusions that may, or may not, differ from another writers point of view.  We, as the interested layperson, can only benefit from this sort of exchange.  Published over 15 years ago many of Diamond's conclusions may have changed, even for him, or possibly been overturned but his basic idea is still valid. (This edition includes a 2003 Afterword by Diamond: \"G,G,&S Today\" that addresses many of these issues) Prior to about 40 thousand years ago all humans were stone-age hunter-gatherers that lived in isolated bands or family groups that probably viewed all strangers with suspicion.  What happened to change that simple beginning into the highly disparate societies that we have today?  How is it that some groups seem to have so many advantages of modern life while others are still living as hunter-gatherers?  But, whatever social system they are living under,  people are basically the same.  Australian Aborigines are just as intelligent and capable of coherent thought as any upper-class European, they only differ in their environmental life style.  Racial differences do not play a part in who are the \"haves\" and who are the \"have-nots\".  So, if race is not a factor, what is?  Concepts like; continental axis orientation, geographical diffusion, domestication potential of plants and animals all help to clarify the issue. The development of agriculture led to a more settled life style and the beginning of complex societies.  Domestication of animals for work or food resulted in exposure to new germs and, in some cases, immunity to certain diseases that were specific to the region of origin.  The list goes on; pottery making, metallurgy, exploitation of maritime resources and trade options.  All these factors, and more, have contributed to who, and when, will be the first to develop the guns, germs, and steel needed for their enterprising ventures into exploration and conquest.  While I had no technical problems with this Kindle edition there are some \"publisher omissions\" that are unfortunate.  Missing are the photo portraits of people from around the world as well as many of the maps and, lastly, the index.  You would think that a high caliber publisher like W.W. Norton would put a little more effort and care into their e-reader releases.\n\nLastRanger", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "AN89MYMWS3FI8", "ProductID": "B000VDUWMC", "Review": "Groundbreaking Book! Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond\n\nGuns, Germs and Steel as the author Jared Diamond succinctly summarizes it, is about why the rise of complex human societies unfolded differently on different continents over the last 13,000 years.  It's an insightful book that provides well-researched information on how human societies evolved and in doing so provides compelling evidence against racially based theories of human history.  This award winning book is 480 pages long and is composed of the following four major parts: 1. From Eden to Cajamarca, 2. The Rise and Spread of Food Production, 3. From Food to Guns, Germs, and Steel, and 4.  Around the World in Five Chapters.\n\nPositives:\n\n1. Award winning Pulitzer Prize book that lives up to all the accolades that it has received.\n2. Well-written, well-researched, and most importantly the ability to convey findings in a lucid manner for all to enjoy and learn from.\n3. As a result of the books compelling arguments, its findings has dismantled racially based theories.  Bravo!\n4. The book provides theories that can and have been applied to better understand other fields, namely economics.\n5. Provides compelling information on how Europe dominated the New World.\n6. Provides a grand unifying theory that explains how societies evolved over the past 13,000 years.\n7. This book doesn't answer all the questions to a satisfying conclusion but it certainly will inspire others (and it already has) to take the mantle from Mr. Diamond and get there.  Sometimes the greatest books are not the ones that give you all the answers but provides you the inspiration to seek them for yourself.\n8. Tables and illustrations that add value.\n9. Fascinating histories about the domestication of plants and animals.\n10. Geography, geography and geography.\n11. Germs as the ultimate weapons.\n12. Writing systems that helps put the puzzle together.\n13. Kleptocrats...and the use of religions to justify their power.\n14. It takes you to societies we know so little about.  Thank you.\n15. Ambitious book that exceeded my expectations.\n16. Thought-provoking, great scholarly work that will be referenced for years to come.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. With an ambitious unifying theory as Mr. Diamond espouses, there will be elements of it that are not satisfying to some critics.  However, from my view point the work of this book in many aspects are groundbreaking and should inspire further research and discussion.\n2. It can be repetitive at times but understandably so.\n3. Some arguments are more speculative than others.\n4. I think the author does go out of his way to be politically correct.\n\nIn summary, This book is anthropology at its best.  It's an inspiring, ground-breaking book that makes compelling arguments on the evolution of societies.  Does it answers all the questions to our satisfaction?  No, but it lays the groundwork for future research.  Mr. Diamond must be commended for a major contribution to history.  This is a must read book. It will require an investment of time but you will be rewarded with wisdom .\n\nFurther recommendations, even books that may go against specific elements of Mr. Diamond's position: \"10,000 Year Explosion...\" by Cochran and Harpending, and \"Before the Dawn...\" by Nicholas Wade.", "Feedback": "positive"}

All the graphs have two lines, one representing glucose and the other insulin. Figure 1.1 sys each unit represents 10 ulU/ml insulin or 75mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.2 the same is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 20mg/dl glucose.  Graph 2.2 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 25mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.3 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 100 mg/dl glucose. There is so little information on the graphs that they are essentially meaningless, even if the same scale had been the same on all of them.\nNow on page 16 you are told that you can figure your body mass index on the chart 2.4.  but the chart has only height and weight boxes. Nowhere in the book are you told what to do with the height and weight figures tocompute your body mass.\nThe back cover says 'charts to determine your insulin resistance and check progress'  implying you will find this information in the book.  But all you get is a statement on page 27 directing you to go to a web site to do an online  'insulin resistance test'.\nHaving found the easy and dramatically effective information from Jason Fung that got my blood glucose reading down over 100 points in 3 days doing his;mini fasts' of no eating between meals for as little time as 5 or 6 hours, I was surprised to find on page 46 of this book the advise:\n'Do eat frequent small meals, at 2-5 hour intervalsgoing long periods of time without eating only encourages more fat storage'\nthe book has pages with day 1,2 ND 3, Ec with about 10 blank lines to chart progress. You are directed to page 39 for information how to do this. Page 39 shows a representation of a scale with one or two circles on one side and one or two squares on the other, representing 'linking and balancing'  protein and carbs.  If you eat two each, then you have one rectangle of 'foods such as vegetables'  if you have one each you have two rectangles.\nWhile there is a lot of test about eating fats,  the traditional last third of the book giving recipes stresses ingredients such as fat free margarine, cheese, and whipped topping '  and using 'sugar free gelatin (full of wholesome sugar substitute we were warned about earlier, and artificial color and flavor)  while we are told people who eat more dairy have less insulin resistance, but are these people eating dairy altered to remove fat ?\nThe book claims things such as that eating fat makes you crave more food, that you can not do anything to lose weight around your weight, and that  eating wheat is just fine, and wheat s the same as any other carbs.\nI will stop here and address these last few 'facts'. This book suggests a diet very similar to what I ate all my life and got fat on, and could never lose weight until I found Atkin's.  eating more NATURAL  fats, and especially in meat, what we call fat but is actually connective tissue such as the thick skin on pork shoulder,  is what kept me from being hungry most of my life-and I almost never get hungry. It also contributed greatly to my regrowing cartlidge in a 'bone to bone' knee I was as told I could not return to normal by a doctor wanting to put in an artificial knee.\nAs for waist size, my personal research taught me that taking 2-4 grams of potassium citrate  twice a day ( intended to remove lead or other heavy metals from your system in 6 weeks, you will lose not weight but trim 2 sizes off your waist size in a week.  I gave a lot of friends I  knew at UFO conference the stuff  andevery one who took it  had their pants falling off by the end of the week.\nAs for exercise, I  also worked construction as a pipefitter for a few years and while eating a diet of protein and natural rbs similar to their 'pared' amounts touted in this book and I never lost an ounce.  In fact I never lost any weight in my life except on the Atkin's diet by first cutting back to zero carbs for a couple weeks, and adding very few back if I wanted to keep it off.\nAnd at a time when most researchers are finding wheat is a big contributor to many of the difficult to solve health problems too many people are plagued with, it is a mystery to figure out  how these authors continue to think that eating wheat is just fine.\nAnyone with health difficulties needs to cut out wheat FIRST  to find out if it is a problem for them because if it is, nothing else you do will ever work.\nI believe this book tells the kind of advise that keeps people from ever getting better. I can not trust their claims that they got so many people better with what they claim works, and if I have to go on line to take tests, why buy the book?\nIf anyone is concerned with insulin resistance  go to YouTube and watch Jason Fung videos and get his book for results that make a difference  as dramatic as I only ever got from Atkin's before.\nMost people who READ to learn about health problems will be smart enough by now to know to be very suspicious about the confusing advice given as fact in this book.", "Feedback": "negative"}

I still have about 20 pounds to go until I'm at my goal weight- but I haven't been this close in YEARS.\n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16, and started struggling with my weight around the same time.  I was never obese, but I was always overweight, even though I was active.  Over the years, I've tried EVERYTHING.  For 4 months earlier this year, I did a vegan diet, and stuck to a 1,600 calorie diet.  I did \"Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga\" 6 days a week, and I walked 3 days a week.  In those 4 months, I GAINED ten pounds.  I was working my BUTT off- but my butt was getting bigger. ;)\n\nI did this \"diet\"- the Insulin Resistance diet- and I've NEVER felt better.  I have energy to spare!  I have the motivation to walk- and I walk 6-10 hours a week.  People who I know can't believe how different I look- they tell me all the time.

Here's my long-term take on this diet.  It *DOES* work for people with insulin resistance.  Here's my caveat:  You have to watch which carbs you're eating.  I can watch calories, pair my proteins with my carbs, and still not lose weight.  I essentially have to cut out the sugars and grains if I want to lose weight that stays off.  I still eat some rice, beans, potatoes- and I eat them in 1/2 cup servings.  I pair them with vegetables and protein.  And with that, I lose weight.  If I do as this book suggests and eat sugar in the recommended quantities?  Yeah, no.  I don't lose weight.\n\nI still stand by this being a great diet option for people who need to follow a low-carb diet.  I just suggest you really watch your carbs mindfully.

The writer lost two sons--I don't understand why she tossed the 3rd one away.  In another sections, she's diagnosed with Type 2 diabetis.  The MD suggests she go go a support group.  Halfway through the meeting, she leaps to her feet and lectures the other.  She tells everyone they are wimps and she's not going to allow them to get her down.  How rude, mean and condescending.  There were people there who may have to face amputation, who have to change their life styles--and she just blew their concerns off because she was so cool and clever.  She says she's a Christian and I will not judge her--but in my experience, CHristians are kinder and more loving when others are grieving.", "Feedback": "negative"}

{"ReviewerID": "AJP44QXY4JBOZ", "ProductID": "B000VZSSM6", "Review": "Very uplifting and encouraging read This is a very great practical book on living the Spirit filled life. Stanley uses many examples, illustrations, and lots of scripture in this book. This is not an academic look at the Holy Spirit but a book focusing on the practical. This book has chapters on the fruit of the spirit, the gifts of the spirit, etc.. For more depth on these topics Jerry Bridges and other authors have written books, but as mentioned this book is practical and not academic, so the content is not going to satisfy a seminary class, but will satisfy anyone wanting to learn how to better live their lives through the power of the Holy Spirit. I have three books on the Holy Spirit and this by far is the best. Living beyond your capacity by Paul Chappell was not very helpful and one I d not recommend. God in You by David Jeremiah seems more in depth and more academic, however I wanted a practical book on the Holy Spirit, and God in You did not seem to be academic or practical enough to fit my bill. So this one by Stanley is the best no question in my library to date.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The book reads much the way he speaks.\n\nThe book gives a brief overview of what it means to live a Spirit filled life. It also provides some examples from Dr. Stanley's life. Finally, it gives some details as to how to open yourself up to living the Spirit filled life.\n\nThis book was easy to read and understand. The book explains many of the scriptures that speak about Spirit filled living. It also uses stories and events from Dr. Stanley's life to demonstrate the scripture meaning. There is also a chapter about Spiritual gifts.\n\nThe key is simply to recognize that all believers have the Holy Spirit living within them. Once you realize and understand and accept this, you will know what to look for and to listen for to be in obedience to the will of God.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone looking to initiate or to further their study of a Spirit filled life.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Looking Up (A personal journey into the Spirit-filled life)\n\n2.  Looking Within (The ministries of the Holy Spirit in the believer)\n\n3.

{"ReviewerID": "A3HDUVOIVI54LH", "ProductID": "B000W4RFBQ", "Review": "This book is quite wonderful and heartwarming and sometimes a bit heartbreaking especially talking about racial topic ofthe time Lily Owens lives with a mean harsh father who owns a peach farm in South Carolina.  Her first memory is of killing her mother accidentally by shooting her with a gun that she was trying to get to her while her parents are arguing as her mother, Deborah is packing up a suitcase.  When Lily does something that her father, T. Ray doesn't like he makes her kneel in a pile of uncooked grits that leave cuts and bruises on her legs.  After her mother died T. Ray brought in a black worker from the fields named Rosaleen to take care of the house and Lily.  Rosaleen is aggressive and not prone to keeping her mouth shut when she should, but she acts as a surrogate mother to Lily.\n\nRight after the Civil Rights Act is signed into law Rosaleen decides to go and register to vote. Lily asks to go with her as it's her birthday and nothing else is going on. T. Ray never gets her anything for her birthday or celebrates it. It's on July 4 so in a way, everyone else is celebrating it.  When they go into town three of the racist men in town start in on Rosaleen and piss her off, so she takes her tobacco spit cup and pours it over their shoes.  This incites them to demand an apology which she refuses to give them and they attack her until the sheriff sees it and puts a stop to it and arrests her and Lily. Lily can't understand why Rosaleen can't just act right.  Or apologize to get out of jail.  T. Ray arrives to get Lily out of jail, but not Rosaleen who is in a real pickle.  The next day when Lily goes to visit her she isn't in jail anymore but the hospital because the sheriff allowed the racist men in to beat her up trying to get her to apologize.  T. Ray had said that there would be no way out for Rosaleen except in a pine box so Lily sets about with an idea of how to break her out.\n\nAfter convincing the store owner where the incident took place in front of not to press charges after using some creative storytelling, she goes to the hospital and makes a call to the nurse to tell the cop guarding the door that the charges have been dropped and for him to come back to the station. When the cop leaves she goes into Rosaleen's room and gets her dressed and they slip out of the hospital.  They begin their trek toward Tiburon, South Carolina because Lily had seen it written on the back of a picture of a black Madonna among her mother's few possessions and she figures to go there and find someone who knows her mother and learn what she can about her.  Rosaleen isn't too happy about this once she finds out, but she doesn't have much choice about it now.\n\nWhen they reach Tiburon Lily goes into the general store to buy some food and sees a bottle of honey with the exact picture of the black Madonna she has on it and asks about it. It turns out a group of local black women make the honey and they live in a crazy pink house.  So Lily and Rosaleen go there to meet up with the Calander sisters: May, June, and August. There was a July, May's twin sister, but she died years ago quite tragically leaving May devastated and carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders and unable to cope.  The sisters convinced her to build a wailing wall in which to place the things that bother her on a piece of paper into the crevices.  June is a talented cello player and a school teacher who keeps turning down the principal's offer of marriage due to the fact that she was left at the altar years ago.  June doesn't like or trust Lily.  August is full of warmth and kindness and takes them in with open arms and teaches Lily the beekeeping business.  Zach, a handsome black high school boy helps her with the business and he and Lily hit it off right from the start.\n\nThe sisters have their own religion that involves a version of Catholicism and a mix of otherness that comes with the wooden boat mast of the black Madonna that hangs out in their living room and that they pray to saying the Hail Mary's to. Once a week they hold services there were other people in the town come to hear the message and pray and dance and touch the heart at the base of the statue.  This seems odd at first, but Lily and Rosaleen quickly get swept up in it.  And no one treats Lily different for being the only white person there. For a girl who has grown up without a mother, she seems to be gaining too many to count.  But the happiness cannot last and T. Ray hasn't given up on finding them and August may have to send them back once Lily tells them the real reason they are there and finds out what she needs to know about her mother, which she dreads to learn at first.  This book is quite wonderful and heartwarming and sometimes a bit heartbreaking.  It does touch on what things were like in the South in 1964 in an honest way while at times being a bit naive when it came to Lily.  I cannot recommend this book enough.\n\nQuotes\nPeople who think dying is the worst thing don't know a thing about life.\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 2)\n\nYou know some things don't matter that much, Lily. Like the color of a house. How big is that in the overall scheme of life? But lifting a persons heartnow, that matters. The whole problem with people is They don't know what matters and what doesnt I was gonna say, The problem is they know what matters, but they don't choose it. You know how hard that it is, Lily? I love May, but it was still hard to choose Caribbean Pink. The hardest thing on earth is choosing what matters.\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 147)\n\nIt is always a relief to empty your bladder. Better than sex, Rosaleen said. As good as it felt, though, I sincerely hoped she was wrong.\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 163)\n\nYou think you want to know something, and then once you do, all you can think about is erasing it from your mind. From now on when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I planned to say, Amnesiac.\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 249)\n\nKnowing can put a curse on a persons life. Id traded in a pack of lies for a pack of truth, and I didn't know which one was heavier. Which one took the most strength to carry around? It was a ridiculous question, though, because once you know the truth, you cant ever go back and pick up your suitcase of lies. Heavier or not, the truth is yours now.\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 155-6)\n\nHave you ever noticed that the more you try not to think, the more elaborate your thinking episodes get?\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 271)\n\nPeople, in general, would rather die than forgive. Its that hard. If God said in plain language, Im giving you a choice; forgive or die, a lot of people would go ahead and order their coffin.\n-Sue Monk Kidd (The Secret Life Of Bees p 277)", "Feedback": "positive"}

Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here.  Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.\n\nNote that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).\n\nI rated this book WARTY!\n\nWARNING!  MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS!  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nI am seriously going to have to quit reading certain categories of novel - novels which have titles like The Mermaid Chair and The invention of Wings. Anything which won a 'medal' is out. Medals are for heroes. I see nothing heroic and everything formulaic about the bulk of such pretentious novels. What else can we ditch? Well, anything which includes a female name in the title (with few exceptions), such as An Abundance of Katherines, and especially if the name does double duty, such as Looking for Alaska. Anything which includes 'dreams' or 'stars' in the title, such as The Fault in Our Stars. Anything which uses a bad or sad and weak metaphor, such as Paper Towns.\n\nOh, and one more which just came to mind: anything which uses a reference to botany or zoology as a comment on human behavior or the human condition, and then employs quotes from some book on the topic as chapter headers is right out. Which explains my attitude towards this novel. Fortunately, I got it on close-out, so I don't feel robbed.\n\nSince it was taking me forever to get to the print version I had of this, I actually pulled it from the library on audio disk so I could listen to it on my daily commute. I quite liked the reading voice at first, since it seemed to match the character, but I discovered after several disks that I probably wouldn't want to spend much time with this character if all I ever got out of her was this flat, rather monotonic slightly southern twang which wasn't so peachy after a while. Nevertheless, I managed to listen all the way through which was more than I can say for several other audio books I've had to endure!\n\nOne major problem with this novel is that it really doesn't know what it wants to be. On the one hand, its a rather unconvincing tale of a young teen's escape from an abusive father. On the other, its a white person once again coming to the rescue of black folks - because y'all know they sure cain't hep th'sel's. Talking of heroic, Martin Luther King was a hero, and he's rightly held in high esteem, but I think its really sad that he fomented an escape from a situation where one race appallingly abused another, while he never himself escaped another kind of slavery: that which goes hand-in-hand with organized religion.\n\nBut I digress. This novel is set in the summer of 1964, when Lily Melissa Owens, the fourteen-year-old, is a very effectively a white slave on her father's peach plantation. She has grown-up thinking she shot her mom (accidentally), and now all she has is a father, Terrance Ray Owens. For reason unexplained, she addresses him as T-Ray, and he punishes her by making her kneel on grits. The family has a house slave, Rosaleen, who is Lily's stand-in mom.\n\nOne day, while accompanying Rosaleen into town so the latter can register to vote, Lily observes Rosaleen perpetrate the idiotic act of 'repaying' verbal abuse from some local jerks by dribbling snuff juice over their shoes. She's arrested and tossed into jail along with Lily, who is shortly thereafter picked up by T-Ray. After T-Ray explains that Rosaleen is lucky to even be alive, Lily discovers that Rosaleen was beaten and is in hospital, so she engineers her escape, and they flee to Tiburon, a nearby town which holds an attraction to Lily because she believes her mother lived there.\n\nBy unbelievably miraculous once in a billion coincidence, Rosaleen and Lily end up at exactly the same house in which her mother did indeed stay for a while before her death. That's pretty much the entire story, but of course, the author puts the pedal to the medal and runs on long after this because clearly this is nowhere near enough angst, suffering, metaphor, and cuteness to make it medal material.\n\nSo we start with a young girl in a kind of slavery, and we end with her in a different kind of slavery, albeit less abusive. We start with her knowing precisely nothing about exactly what happened that fateful day when her mom was shot, and we end with her knowing precisely nothing about exactly what happened that fateful day when her mom was shot. We start with her living a sheltered life, and we end with her living a sheltered life. We start with her having a father and no mother, and we end with her having a father and no mother. Rosaleen starts out as a housekeeper, and she ends-up as a housekeeper. She starts out unregistered to vote, and she ends-up unregistered to vote.\n\nAlrighty then.\n\nQuite frankly I don't see the point of this novel.\n\nI would have liked it better had it not trivialized African American struggles by including two stories of a person of color being arrested for a legitimate offence, and trying to portray it as an abuse. There was no need to include the struggle for equal rights in a story which had nothing to do with that struggle, so I assume it was done merely show the story's medal, er mettle.\n\nThe story rambled far too much. It went on an on about trivial details which did nothing to paint a better picture or to move the story along. It was boring and predictable, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with bees (except in that Lily's middle name is from the Greek for 'bee'), beehives, honey, or secret lives. Frankly, Lily Melissa ought to have been named Mary Sue. This sad excuse for a novel was actually a waste of my time.", "Feedback": "negative"}

When her black \"stand in mother\" is put in jail for insulting some racist men, Lily springs her out and they run away together.

Being able to do so makes it hard for me to be too enthralled about reading further unless there really interesting characters and sub plots to focus on. Or, the story itself is so well written that it is intriguing whether you know who did it or not, like the old Colombo tv shows.\n\nThis story really had known of those factors to draw me in, it was dry, extremely slow, and almost completely unbelievable. I found it hard to swallow that a person from the 'outside world', especially one of law enforcement, would be immediately tempting in even the most basic/innocent sexual way by anyone living in a somewhat closed and sheltered religious community of any kind.\n\nSo being very doubtful of the basic premise of this story, main characters whose inner/outer conversations and thoughts are very stilted, and knowing who the bad guy was almost immediately, left this a very boring and dry read in my mind.\n\nYou may find it different in yours though, thus the OK rating.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Jewtown, the police, and gentile neighbours called it. Normally, very few criminal reports came from this quiet, orthodox area.  The police had been pursuing the Foothill Rapist who had committed crimes  elsewhere.  Law enforcement tried to make a connection, but religious beliefs, fear and embarrassment had sealed the victim's lips.\n\nPeter Decker is attracted to Rina Lazarus, a practising, young Jewish widow, who lives with her two sons in the compound.  Could Sarah Adler have been mistaken for Rina?  Rina recalled her dependency when she was with Yitzchak. That paranoia encircled her again  The invisible fear shackles had to be broken.\n\nThis Is a crime story, but also, the first of several novels written by Faye Killerman which feature the budding, and developing romance between an orthodox Jewish woman and an outsider. This novel lays the foundation for more Decker, Lazarus novels which pair the two as lovers, and intelligent crime solvers. The undercurrents are deep and freely flowing.

She lived in an tight knit community centered around a school, and was one of the few who had outside experience.  When there was a brutal rape, she ended up being the one who worked best with the police.  The sense of community and its isolation from the mainstream plays a large part in the story.

Kellerman's next-to-last novel, Gun Games, focusing in considerable part on the relationship between 15-year-old \"adopted son\" Gabe, a musical prodigy, and a 14-year-old Persian girl and precocious opera lover, verges on being creepy. The Ritual Bath, however, is an engrossing introduction to Orthodox Jewish life combined with a solid murder mystery.

{"ReviewerID": "A2DTC4T8Q6R0NP", "ProductID": "B000W916C0", "Review": "The Ritual Bath - Faye Kellerman I liked the basic story of this book; the characters were well developed, I thought Rina and Peter both were realistic as were their conflicts with their feelings for each other. The crimes being investigated were a little convoluted to me, but only a little. I don't want to say too much, but there were some coincidences that I found a little too coincidental\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the changing POV, but that's a personal preference, not a flaw of the book. I prefer staying in the heads of the main characters, and there were a few times we were in the POV of some minor characters, which I found a little jarring.\n\nMy biggest problem with this book is probably with Kellerman's tendency to sprinkle the dialogue with Hebrew terms and not translate them. Most of the time, it's easy enough to figure out, at least generally, what's being said from the context, but there were times that it was still unclear, and there was no translation. I'm all for learning new words, I have no problem with that, but I just feel that if they're in a new language, the author should provide some kind of translation.\n\nShe did a great job, however, with explaining a lot of the concepts of the Jewish faith, concepts that I wasn't familiar with. The mikvah and the yeshiva, for example, are concepts that I was only familiar with in the broadest of terms, and Kellerman did a fantastic job of working her explanations of them into the story without it seeming like an info dump. I only wish that she done that with some of the terms, not just the concepts.\n\nI did like this, and I'll probably read more of this series, though not necessarily right away.", "Feedback": "moderate"}
{"ReviewerID": "A7YMD8MSOBO1I", "ProductID": "B000W916C0", "Review": "The First in the Series NO SPOILER ALERTS HERE.  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS.\n\nThe Ritual Bath, a mikvah, is used by orthodox Jews to ritually cleanse their bodies and souls.  It is performed by immersing one's entire body into a pool of running (as opposed to stagnant) water and chanting prayers.\n\nThat hardly seems to be a place where danger lurks, yet, Kellerman uses the locale to introduce the reader to many of the features of her writing.  First, she employs Hebrew words, foreign to most of us. These seamlessly explain customs, holidays, and rituals. To her credit, they don't interfere with the dialogue that she skillfully writes. Second, her protagonists can seemingly never have a relationship.  Rina is a modern orthodox Jew.  Peter is a gentile Los Angeles police detective.  Third, the author turns an implausible idea into reality.  (No plot giveaways here.  (Read and enjoy it for yourself.)  Next, being set in L.A., an enormous metropolitan area, allows us to accept the diversity of cultures within the plot. Last, Kellerman's use of opposites creates the right amount of tension between her protagonists.\n\nSome mystery writers, such as Lee Child, write page-turners that are impossible to put down.  While Kellerman's plot turns, it lacks this edgy excitement throughout the book.  The dnouement, however, is well done.  She has more than one potential antagonist for us and the ending is surprising.\n\nThe portrayal of the main female character, Rina Lazarus, is strong.  The author has given her a firm voice.  We can picture her, she rings true. It is Peter Decker, the male protagonist, who is not fully developed.  He is somewhat like the TV detective Peter Falk played on the Columbo series decades ago.  At face value he is a less dimensional personality than Rina.  But, like that TV detective, there is more to Peter than we initially see.\n\nAs a first in a lengthy series, The Ritual Bath is a good introduction for the reader.  We learn about the characters.  Who they are, what their value systems and beliefs are, and how they meet. This back story is essential in understanding their motivations.  If you like serial writing and enjoy the familiarity of characters and settings, this story is a good place to start.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I've been reading a lot of World War II books lately and needed a break from the heavy reading, so I ordered up this book for my Kindle. I'd heard of Faye Kellerman but never read any of her books. I always like to start at the beginning rather than dive into the middle of a series. For one thing, when a series begins oftentimes the author's protagonists are fresh and more 3 dimensional. As time goes on, too many times in a series the author gets tired of their creations and simply write to satisfy their fan base. Anyway, in this book Kellerman introduces a duo that is definitely different from any other two protagonists I've seen...one is a detective in a sex crime unit, and the other is the female target of a crime in a yeshiva (which makes her a very religious Jew). This introduces the reader not only to a good mystery/crime but also to a chance to learn about another culture, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The history and the religious information made the people become more alive in the book, and a lot of the problems of the growing attraction between Decker (the cop) and Rina (the woman in the yeshiva) becomes more understandable when the rules and laws of the Jewish religion is explained.\n\nThe crimes involved are solved in due course, and the book is a satisfying read. My only complaint is the constant bad language. I'm not one for constant gutter language. I want to read another one of these, and I sure hope this isn't a constant trend because it will determine if I read the entire series, which I think I could enjoy otherwise...", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A1NBHCZTKZCR3W", "ProductID": "B000W93A42", "Review": "Not a typical Garwood Historical Romance I have to admit, the first time I read this book, with such high expectations, I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a story similar to her many other wonderful stories like my all time favorites, Ransom and The Secret.\nHer quirky sense of humor, her witty dialog, well fleshed out characters that you can't help but love or hate...just weren't present in this book. At least, not to the extent that we've come to expect and appreciate so much.\nI especially missed the development of the romance between the main characters. A man who marries a woman because he owes someone else a favor, not because he has any interest in her for herself; a woman who marries because she feels forced into it by her circumstances...doesn't make for a very good start, to say the least.\nI have to say that it was probably a much more realistic portrayal of marriage than her other H/R books. People rarely married for love in that time period. They married for title/land/dowry, and pretty much anything But love.\nHowever, I don't read her books for historical accuracy. I read them for great entertainment and pure fun!\nAfter giving the book another chance, I found that although it wasn't her usual \"formula\", and I still missed the sense of humor she's so noted for, the story was a little darker than her usual stories and gave less opportunity for humor. There was some here and there, but I felt that the story would have been much improved if her character had shown a cute sense of humor and been a little less perfect, a little more \"human\". A woman who had real faults and made a few real mistakes would have been much more sympathetic and appealing.\nOverall, I feel that it's a story well worth reading, but if this is your first time to read a Julie Garwood book, do yourself a favor and read \"Ransom\" or \"The Secret\" first. Once you know that she really is a wonderful author, you may be able to enjoy this book for what it is; a pretty good read, but one of her less than stellar efforts.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

To my surprise...I really enjoyed the book.  Yes, the main characters don't really \"get\" together until very late in the book but the story was beautiful.  I for one don't read Julie Garwood books solely for the romance but for the historical content as well.  It all becomes magical to be able to be transported into that period of time. It was entertaining, it had substance, it was a nice love story.  I think that people should definitely give the book a chance.  To each his own...everyone has their own opinion...for example I didn't like Rebellious Desire or the Prize for that matter but I still gave it a chance and those books weren't terribly bad I just didn't care for it.\n\nAt any rate give the book a chance.  I'm glad she is still writing even if the characters have some of the same descriptions...smelling like roses, smelling like leather, herculian men, viking men, all the women stood up to their intended...But it's all nice in its own way in my opinion.", "Feedback": "positive"}

This turned out to be a very good book, but it does require a bit of patient whimsy on the part of the reader, at least in the beginning.\n\nLike the other two books in the series, Garwood sets up the tale by telling us the back story of the main character; in this case, Princess Gabrielle, a member of the now defunct royal family of a mythical country called Saint Biel. Given in marriage to a highland laird by King John, Gabrielle is in the highlands for her wedding. But the machinations of a couple of ruthless barons leaves Gabrielle in disgrace and at the mercy -- and under the protection of -- another highland laird.\n\nThe hero is pretty stock, but what's great about this story is the personality of Gabrielle. She is not a weak or silly woman, but someone with excellent self esteem who faces adversity as it comes. She isn't overly maternal, or a healer, or any of the usual female traits that makeup a character of her type. She is unique in my experience, and this is so refreshing that I slowed my reading in order to savor it. It's fun to watch her manage the laird without confrontation. She constantly surprises him, and his reactions to her make him a more interesting character. Gabrielle is very original and likeable and I would love to see more female characters created in her image.\n\nGabrielle also has a close relationship with her four St. Biel guards, who have been with her since childhood; they are great characters in their own right, and her interactions with them are fun to watch.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining read, maybe slightly more complicated than the first two books, but still very good.

I am unsure how to rate this one because I am worried that the magic for me just wasn't there. I am wondering how to rate. I did enjoy the book, just not as much as the others. I felt the formula was off.\n\nI felt the book was off because the Colm & Gabrielle pretty much didn't even meet each other until the midway point in the book. There was such a confusing back story and all the other mini plots that my head was spinning. I just wanted Colm and Gabrielle to meet and it was getting frustrating that it hadnt happened yet. Afterall in all the other books, Garwoods characters were married near the beginning of the book. (which I loved)\n\nAnother big difference I felt from the previous novels and how Shadow Music was written was the writing style in general. Garwood has really great prologues. Shadow Music also had a great prologue but it felt like by the 4th chapter I was still reading a prologue and waiting for the story to actually begin. The story of the battling barons was a great set up for the conflict but it just felt to long.\nThe battle where Liam was injured and Gabrielle and her guard saved him was great but I still didn't understand why the need to keep it a secret was such a big deal. I initially thought that Liam was going to be the hero of this story not his brooding Laird brother.\nThe entire Abbey chapters where Gabrielle was disgraced started really to frustrate me. I wanted them to meet and it still hadnt happened yet.\nMoving forward to Gabrielle and Colm finally meeting was such a let down. I was thinking to myself it took chapters and chapters to get here and that was it?\n\nI did like that Gabrielle was a bit different of heroin than the other female characters. I like the Garwood doesnt just write the same characters over and over with just a name change to make them different. Having said that, I found myself getting frustrated with Gabrielle on many occasions. Her stupidity (naivety) made me want to shake her. I am not exactly sure why Gabrielle and Colm fell in love. I didn't connect with them. I felt the love was a bit forced and I felt that I was being told to feel this or that instead of automatically loving the couple.\n\nOkay what I did like was the anticipation of the climax. I did like Gabrielles guards. I loved the 5 yr old twin boys being added to the story (Garwood does excellent children characters) because this story needed some sort of comic relief. So all in all, not the best of her historicals but I still enjoyed it a lot.", "Feedback": "positive"}

When I closed this book, I asked myself \"What the heck did I just read?\"\n\nI have not enjoyed Julie Garwood's foray into contemporary romantic suspense. Not at all. So when I saw that she was not only returning to her historical romance roots but also to her favored setting in Scotland, I was thrilled.\n\nThis was the same woman who has written The Bride and The Secret and so many other funny, warm, poignant romances with great alpha heroes and quirky fun heroines. I have read and re-read all of her early paperbacks from the 80s and 90s. She's on keeper shelf.\n\nSO I settled down to get into this book. The beginning starts just fine and I am thrilled. But then something crazy happens. The characters seem like lifeless retreads of some of her previous characters. The plot, likewise, is a meandering mess that tries to recall the glories of The Bride and The Secret and fails miserably.\n\nThe villains are pathetic and laughable (and they were not intended to be) and truthfully, you never really understand why anyone does what they do.\n\nI seriously skipped whole passages, thinking...wait...it has got to get better. Right? It never did. She includes a spate of secondary characters that are obvious attempts to add color and texture, something I am usually very grateful for. But these too fall flat. Nothing about this book worked for me on any level.\n\nAnd can someone please tell me why the heck this book is entitled Shadow Music? The plot, the characters nothing alludes to this. Yeah, at the end of one chapter deep into the book while a bad guy is about to get killed he sees his killer's shadow and then hears the 'music' of a sword being drawn from a scabbard. That's it. That is all there is that has even the most distant connection to the title. I kept wondering as I was reading what the title referred to. Things like this just piss me off.\n\nIf this were the first Garwood book I'd ever read, I'd've simply dismissed it as a generic piece of romance fluff and I would not have bothered to look the author up again. But I know what this author is capable of and I am severely disappointed because I know she can write better than this.", "Feedback": "negative"}

I am so glad I did read it, and I loved it as much as the first two books. I am honestly confused about everyone's displeasure. Some thought the story took too long to get going, but I didn't notice undue delay and felt the extra background information was needed for the story. Others felt Brodick's character was unrecognizable, and though I admit he had softened a bit from the first two books, I felt it was already happening at the end of the second book and largely due to being married. One of the things I really liked about this book was Gabrielle's guard and their interaction with Colm and his men. There is something enjoyable about the banter between a group of men that are close to each other, particularly when they are all protecting the same woman. I enjoyed the same thing in the second book with Brodick's guard. I enjoyed Colm and Gabrielle, and felt they were likable, engaging main characters.

The book was originally written in 2009 and definitely shows that Trump hasn't changed his position on topics over the past 7 years, and his personality seems the same and appears to have been written in his voice. It does give a better insight into his way of thinking in business and explains several rumors heard about him over the years. He doesn't hesitate to use names which allows the reader to get a very vivid picture of what he's talking about. Definitely worth the $2 spent.

I found the idea of an alpha and omega werewolf romance to be refreshing.  Yes, Laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story - but, I like yaoi.  He is a little effeminate, which may seem stereotypical, but there are men like this. Certainly not all gay men, or even all \"bottoms.\"  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical? Because this is a fantasy romance not real life!  Laney's clumsiness is a little over the top, but his relationship with Dev is sweet and hot.

It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.\n\nDev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.\n\nWhen Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.  Laine and Dev accept the circumstances quickly.  Laine fills in the situation of what is going on with the bully alpha to Dev and Dev realizes that he will have to take the guy on if he wants to stay in the area.\n\nDev is part-owner in a construction company and his friends and part-owner join him.  The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.\n\nIt is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.\n\nIt was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

I really enjoyed the diverse, well-drawn characters and the dramatic tension, two things which seem to be Langley's strengths.\n\nBut both are ENTIRELY missing from this short book. The characters are beyond shallow, and the plot is contrived and stupid. The characters meet, discover they're mates, and immediately fall in to bed together, despite the fact that one of them was very recently almost raped. What? Really? In her other books the characters go through a struggle, coming to terms with finding their mates and deciding how to deal, but there is no drama or development here whatsoever, just sex and attempts at humor that fall completely flat.\n\nTo be fair, I couldn't get to the end, so maybe it does get better.

It seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot. However, the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character, no one is perfect after all, there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story, even for the cheap price.

It seemed it was edited away, I don't know how to explain it. It felt too rushed, although it had the potential for something more exciting.

Langley created a wonderful world of werewolves and mates and love and romance, and With Love is a fun tale indeed.\n\nDevlin is visiting another town, looking for a place for he and his business partner to move their construction company to. He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack. One thing about werewolves.... they recognize their mate instantly, that special person that Fate has chosen for him, and the omega Laine is Devlin's mate. He quickly claims Laine as his, and now must work to dispatch the Alpha and remove him from his post so the town can be in peace again and he and his Laine can live happily ever after.\n\nThe erotic nature is wonderfully sexy, it's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, and it's all-around good fun. The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.\n\nI heartily recommend it, and especially recommend \"Without Reservations\" and \"With Caution\" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations).

While omega wolves are the lowest wolves of a pack, Devlin knows that they are still invaluable to the smooth running of a pack and deserving of protection.  Getting in the middle of the ruckus, Dev stops the assault, which only re-directs the alpha's hatred toward him. Feeling a tingling along his spine, Devlin is both astonished and ecstatic that this unconscious omega might be his mate.  It isn't until the omega wakes up that Devlin will know for sure.\n\nLaine Campbell smells something wonderful as he slowly reaches consciousness.  Unsure of where he is, he opens his eyes and is instantly delighted and amazed at what he sees. He has a mate of his very own and this mate is hot! Not only is he hot, but he seems to feel the same way as Laine.  Not quite understanding how to proceed, Laine happily lets Devlin take over and enjoys every aspect of their lovemaking.\n\nLaine and Devlin set out to slowly explore their relationship.  Devlin has no plans to let Laine go, no matter that the alpha of Asheville is a jerk and a bully.  Devlin plans to show Victor how an alpha is supposed to act and he is going to enjoy every minute of it!\n\nOnce again J. L. Langley has woven a tremendous story of love and acceptance.

As she grew older she started to have more symptoms of the disease and suffered for many years without medication.\n\nThroughout the book you will read completely honest revelations of what it is like to be on medication and to be off medication. You will be amazed at how creative a writer Elyn R. Saks is and how she remembers precises details of her life, even down to conversations she had with numerous people. Obviously she has a brilliant mind to remember with such clarity.\n\nAt times this book can be shockingly honest but it is never frightening as I thought it might be. Elyn R. Saks always seems to have protections in place so when she falls gravely ill she has a support system and friends to help her.\n\nFor some of the book you may feel frustrated that Elyn R. Saks thinks she can function without medication. Each time she is thrown back into a debilitating psychosis. The triggers are interesting and for that reason I think this book can explain a mentally ill person's basic needs for understanding and support.\n\nAs we watch Elyn R. Saks struggle with her demons we are invited into a very private world of fears most will never experience.

{"ReviewerID": "A1U360OMVQRPUB", "ProductID": "B000WJVKU8", "Review": "The House of Chaos is Built Kelly McCullough continues to rack up big points with his ongoing science/fantasy series starring Ravirn, a child of the Fates from Greek mythology.  The first book, WEBMAGE, was an excellent story, introducing a smart-mouthed, quick-thinking, magnet for trouble that reminded me a lot of Roger Zelazny's signature characters.\n\nLike Zelazny's Corwin of Amber and Jack of Shadows, Ravirn tells his own story in a first-person narrative that explodes onto the pages and keeps moving along at a brisk pace.  Since I'd read the first book, the second book, CYBERMANCY, didn't offer any challenges to lock into the world.  I felt like I was stepping back into a gathering of old friends.  That's how you know you have excellent characters - when your readers can drop back in and never wonder once who is who.\n\nI call these books science/fantasy because McCullough insists on making technology and magic both driving factors of the series.  Not only is Ravirn a child of the Fates who's gifted with awesome magical abilities, he's also a computer geek that knows his way around hacks and cracks.  As steeped as I am in computer-speak, I was sometime challenged with having to keep up with the amount of information in Ravirn's narrative, but even when I lost the thread of something (I blame my ADHD, not McCullough's writing) it didn't take me long to catch up.\n\nEven cooler than that, though, Ravirn turns out to be an emerging chaos god who's about to hang a shingle in the Greek pantheon.  That story alone is worth the price of the book.\n\nThere are lots of stories in the second book of the series, though.  Ravirn's friendship with Melchior -- the webgoblin he created, designed, programmed, and eventually gave independence to - is still at the forefront of the adventure.  Likewise, Cerice - Ravirn's lady love - returns with a host of new issues as well.  Her webgoblin's name is Shara, but she has a tendency to take a human form that looks an awful lot like Mae West, complete with ample charms and double entendre enough to make a sailor blush.\n\nAt the end of WEBMAGE, Shara inadvertently got trapped in Hell.  Hades, that is.  Cerice is as dedicated to Shara as Ravirn is to Melchior.  So you know that Ravirn has to journey to Hades, risking certain death in the Land of the Dead as he outsmarts Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades.  Thankfully, Ravirn has been playing cards with the dog/s for some time, so he knows a thing or two.\nThe story quickly takes shape as Ravirn attempts his feats of derring-do for his lady love.  Who might not even love him in the same way he loves her.  I really got into all these balls McCullough kept throwing in the air.  There's always a new reason to keep turning pages.  One of the strongest aspects about the books that I enjoy is the fact that McCullough plays fair with the whole Greek mythology.  More to the point, if not for one of the most basic myths, this story would never even have taken place.\n\nPeople who haven't tried the series really don't know what they're missing.  McCullough has true world-building skills, a great sense of Greek mythology, and the eye of a thriller writer.  The blend of technology and magic is absolutely amazing, and I'm surprised no one has thought to do it quite like this before.\n\nThe first-person narrative pulls readers in quickly and introduces them to the action and the world effortlessly.  I like the humor, the puns and the jokes, a lot.  It fits the characters perfectly.  And now, with Ravirn's mysterious future slightly more clear, I can't wait to see where the third book takes him.  I'm definitely going along for the trip when the book comes out.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Ravirn, or Raven as he is now often called since the events of the first book, is one hell of a hacker (pun intended!). This time he is going to need to push all his vaunted skills to the utmost because he needs to hack into Hades to retrieve his girlfriend's webgoblin Shara; in Shara's memory is locked all his girlfriend Cerice's research on her doctorate in computer science.\nThe catch? For him to bring that off, he needs to face Cerberus, the three-headed Hound of Hell which guards the River Styx and the Gate of Hell, which none may pass through save death. And Ravirn would much prefer to do that alive and in the flesh. Seems like an impossible task? Well, he does have help in the tiny shape of his trusted side-kick Melchior, his shape-changing, self-aware laptop (aka webgoblin). Having given him a subroutine designed to provide a touch of sarcasm and back talk, he long ago exceeded his specs and developed a soul. Not to mention a wicked sense of humor and a tendency to speak his mind. Can Ravirn bring it off without crashing the mweb (the magical Internet that ties all the infinite worlds of possibility into one gigantic matrix and keeps reality running)? Or without getting stuck on the wrong side of the Styx?\n\nWell, one thing for sure: if he does succeed in \"getting out alive\", all Hell will definitely break loose and he'll have made Hades, the Lord of the Dead himself, into an immortal enemy. Oh yes, and the Fates, the three crones who measure out the destiny of every living being, are just waiting for him to make a misstep since their previous confrontation so they can fall on him like the proverbial ton of bricks. Although, they'll leave the \"coming down on\" to the Furies, the three sisters Tisiphone, Alecto and Megaera, female personifications of vengeance who make harpies seem like nice, friendly Tweety-birds.\n\nKelly McCullough has created a new subgenre in science fantasy with a fascinating blend of magical, mythological and computer elements mixed into a rollicking adventure filled with wild and wicked humor and nonstop action (and a dash of romantic relief).

Without it, the multiverse would be like a hard drive without a directory. Ravirn was designed to maintain it. He is a hacker and sorcerer. He WAS the prince of the middle house of Fate. In fact, the Fates are his great-aunts. These three are not the old hags most humans believe. They are more like Amazonian-to-the-extreme huntresses. Clothos is the spinner of life threads. Atropros wields the shears. But it was Lachesis who revoked Ravirn's name and cast him out of the family. Interestingly enough, Clotho declared him a legitimate force for chaos and gave him the new name of Raven. A name he HATES.\n\nMelchior is Raven's webgoblin. (Sort of like a familiar.) He can take the shape of a goblin or a laptop. Cerice is Raven's girlfriend. Until recently, Cerice had a webpixie named Shara. Shara could take the form of a pixie or a PDA. Shara sacrificed herself to save Raven's life. Cerice is not only hurt emotionally at Shara's death, but is also academically shattered. You see, Cerice is finishing up a doctorate in Computer Science. The little PDA has all six years of Cerice's work on it and is currently residing on the wrong side of the River Styx.\n\nSo Raven must trick Cerberus (the dread guardian of the underworld and Raven's card buddy), hack into the computer of Lucifer's, and rescue Shara. Impossible for anyone else, but not Raven. However, this is where all ... well ... Hades breaks loose. Since her rebirth, Shara has begun acting a bit strange. The mweb is fraying and will soon disappear. Persephone is dealing some sort of goddess blackmail with Raven; and this is all just the beginning.\n\nEveryone has been despairing of Raven's common sense for years. He seems to always be taking on higher entities than himself. And Raven is about to prove them all correct ... again.\n\n***** Author Kelly McCullough has the most remarkable writing talent I have ever read, in a \"myth-fanta-sci-full\" sort of way. (Yes, that is a real word. Look in the dictionary and see where I penciled it in.) Not satisfied to write a single genre or to use a sub-genre already made, he has created a new template that others will build stories upon in later years.

The author not only lists these discoveries for us but also points out their historical significance and the circumstances surrounding their discoveries.\n\nSeveral of these discoveries are generally familiar to us from newspapers, like Tutankhamen (Tut) Tomb, Machu Picchu, the Rosetta Sone, Pompeii, and Troy.  Others are vaguely familiar like Akrotiri, Nineveh, Leakys work, the tomb of 10,000.  Interestingly, several of the most famous archeological events were discovered accidentally - pure serendipity!  Others required much effort and extensive spending .  It is difficult to discuss all of them here but two stand out as very significant. Take the Rosetta Stone, which was accidentally discovered by Napoleons forces while cleaning the Nile river in 1799.  The writing on this stone enabled the deciphering of the hieroglyphic language thus opening up the ancient history of the Egyptians which was a mystery for 2000 years. But Tuts tomb was considered  the greatest discovery of the 20th Century and also the most rewarding. In a US tour in 1976 it attracted over 8 million visitors and brought over $100 million in income.\n\nThere is little doubt that archeological  exploration has been increasing steadily since archeology became an official discipline in the 18th century. Greater awareness has been one of the factors behind this. Nations have been taking pride in exploring their cultural and architectural history. But archeological projects require funds and this has been a handicap. Many believe that funds are more usefully invested elsewhere, e.g. in medical care and in fighting poverty.  As in other projects, politics are becoming instrumental in setting budgets and  priorities .\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a mystifying attachment to old archeological events and artifacts. At the state level we find Greece and Egypt in legal fights with English and other museums demanding the return of of some of their archeological objects that were captured in the old colonial days when controls were absent. Even at the family level we find people taking pride in  buying  and owning remains of old columns or artifacts even if they go back to more than 3500 years. Thankfully, this has now become illegal in most countries.\n\nFuad R Qubein\nAug. 2017", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A3MV1KKHX51FYT", "ProductID": "B000WJOVFY", "Review": "Entertaining Education Ten Discoveries That Rewrote History\n\nPatrick Hunt is a global archaeologist who teaches Classics and Archaeology at Stanford University. His research was featured in various history and science magazines and the History Channel. He lives in northern California with his wife, and spends several months a year abroad pursuing historical and archaeological research. The Contents of this 226 page book list the Introduction, the ten chapters, and a Selected Bibliography. This book resulted from a popular course at Stanford University. Our understanding of ancient history is influenced by a few major discoveries. Archaeology tells about the past when there are no history records. This is a very readable and interesting popular history book.\n\nChapter 1 tells about the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1797 Egypt. It allowed reading the ancient Egyptian written language. Champollion is credited for its decipherment. Chapter 2 tells about the discovery of Troy in present day Turkey in 1870 using the description in the Iliad. It was no longer a myth. The rediscovery of Troy (Ilion) helped to create modern archaeology, science not grave robbery. Chapter 3 discusses Ninevehs Assyrian Library found near Mosul in 1849. It found many works like the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Law Code of Hammurabi. The former had an account of a great flood like in Genesis. Chapter 4 tells about the discovery of King Tuts Tomb in 1922. It had never been looted and contained many treasures. Tut died young; a bad leg fracture could have caused a fatal infection.\n\nChapter 5 tells about the discovery of Machu Picchu in the Peruvian High Jungle in 1916. It is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World, one of the most perfect examples of Inca architecture. Chapter 6 discusses Pompeii, discovered in 1748. The eruption of Vesuvius buried Pompeii in two days. It preserved Roman architecture and artifacts. The fields around Pompeii were rich and fertile from aged lava soil. The eruption buried the town in a few hours so the remains are intact and complete. Chapter 7 tells about the Dead Sea Scrolls found in 1947. They provided information on biblical manuscripts. They were hidden during the Jewish revolt against Roman rule in 70 AD. This discovery was complicated by political conflicts.\n\nChapter 8 is about Thera, an island in the Aegean Sea. In 1969 archaeologists discovered a whole city buried by volcanic eruption around 1920 BC. Did this event result in the story of Atlantis by Plato? The uncovered buildings were sophisticated. Chapter 9 discusses the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. Louis and Mary Leakey discovered a hominid skull from around 1.7 million years ago. They were not primates and not humans. The discovery of a complete fossil skeleton said to be over 3.2 million years old was a huge find. Chapter 10 discusses the Tomb of 10,000 Warriors found in central China when farmers were digging a well during a drought. These terra-cotta warriors are detailed with individual features that represented ten different Chinese ethnic groups. This is the largest mausoleum in the world. It records the advanced metallurgy of China from 22 centuries ago.\n\nThis is worth reading for general information. The Selected Bibliography has a list for each chapter if you want more information.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Rosalind has no memory of her life before the Sherbrookes found her and after six months of not saying a word, the first time she speaks is to sing a song.\n\nNow Rosalind is all grown up and is having her first season in London when she meets Nicholas Vail, a mysterious man who seems completely taken with her. When Rosalind's best friend, Ryder's son Grayson, finds a magical book written in code, no one but Rosalind can make sense of it. Now the trio is about to uncover some very surprising secrets, and Rosalind finds herself falling madly in love with Nicholas, who has his own reasons for wanting to stay close to Rosalind. But her past is about to find her...\n\nI may have read some of Coulter's works in the past but if I did it's been so long I can't remember anything about them. I was intrigued by the concept of The Wizard's Daughter and had to give it a try. Unfortunately I was disappointed and even worse, the title of the book gives away a key element that isn't revealed until almost the end of the book. The story would have had a much more powerful impact if we didn't already know who Rosalind was from the title.\n\nThe story takes quite a while to really get going. Partially this is due to character history, but a big part is all the time spent where all they are doing is reading the magical book. I loved the idea of having a mystery that is only uncovered by translating the secret encoded message. I just didn't feel it was necessary to spend so much time where that's all they are doing. Maybe that was the only way to get the mystery across, but it seems to me there could've been a way to do it that was a little more interesting.\n\nHowever, once the bulk of the book translation is done, events start unfolding at quite a rapid pace as we find out who Rosalind is and why she has forgotten all these years. I never really bought entirely into the romance of Nicholas and Rosalind however. I can't even explain why, I just didn't feel the chemistry that should be present between two people who fall madly in love overnight, even if Nicholas did have ulterior motives in the beginning. I was more interested in Grayson and wish we could have spent a little more time with him. I can only hope he has his own story coming before too long as I'd love to spend more time with him.\n\nWhile The Wizard's Daughter felt rather uneven to me and I thought more could have been done with the story, I did enjoy it enough to finish the book. I also enjoyed getting to know the Sherbrooke clan and look forward to reading more about them. I already have about 4 or 5 audio books in the series saved on my MP3 player to listen to at some point. I do intend to give Coulter a few more chances in case this book just wasn't up to par with what she is capable of with her talent.\n\n Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2008.

Yes, there were some unanswered questions, and a few parts were confusing, but I think a book about magic is supposed to be that way.

Several of the characters appear in most of the books, making them seem like old friends as you read.\n\nThe first book started slow and was just a little disappointing.  The main characters were rather wimpy, and the Vampires (in all of the books) are quite weak and susceptible to injury compared to what most of us are used to reading.  I was wondering at that point whether I was going to have to struggle through the rest of the books.  Dialogue sometimes seemed a little stilted and awkward.\n\nThe next 4 books kept getting better and better.  Part of that might have been because the repeating characters were getting more interesting as their personalities were developing.  The final book seemed too short, and because it had none of the familiar characters, was not as interesting for me.\n\nOverall, a good read.  It would have been a solid 4 Star for me if not for the first and last books.", "Feedback": "positive"}

All those years ago, back when the imprint was Silhouette Shadows, Eric Marquand stole my heart.  The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.\n\nIf you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!\n\nA human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.\n\nWith this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.\n\nHaving read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.\n\nI truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.

The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters, that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However, the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing, I'm not sure how to put into words, but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example, Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this.

You could say external forces looking to exterminate us. That would certainly be valid, but I'm always been more of an implosion versus explosion guy in terms threats. Frankly, I think our own seditionists are the biggest threat to our liberty. They'll bring down this country far earlier than any terrorists ever will. Over the last forty years the radicals have marched through our organizations, universities, and government and allowed what was once the counter-culture to become the culture. Nowhere is this more true than in our judiciary wherein the laws crafted by our representatives in the legislature have been struck down by judges who think it is their role to teach us what we should really want.\n\nIn the words of former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall: You do what you think is right and let the law catch up. Only, it's not the judiciary's role to make laws and that's why Mark Levin penned his masterpiece Men in Black: How the Supreme Court is Destroying America. The book came out in 2005 so, as always, I got to its pages a little late. Unfortunately, nothing is going to change in the immediate future so it remains pertinent. Some of you may know Mark Levin's name, but, honestly, before this year I never listened to his talk radio show. After a month I discovered he's the best host out of them all. He also excels at writing. Essentially, Men in Black mirrors his approach to verbal conservatism: it's insightful, concise, and ruthlessly on topic. There's not a wasted word here. What I found most attractive about its narrative is that he makes extensive use of primary source documents. He lets the justices, in their opinions, tell their own tale. The book is a compilation of history and cogent analysis. He discusses specifically several of the 100 justices who have been members of the Supreme Court, and their flaws were readily apparent. They were men, not gods.\n\nLevin offers readers an outstanding discussion of the most important court cases in our nation's history. Many of them I had read about before but have long since forgotten. His discussion of religion in Chapter 3 and the establishment clause was thoroughly enlightening. Specifically, we see how cases like Everson v. Board of Education created the fallacious doctrine of there being a \"wall of separation\" between church and state. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Wallace v. Jeffree illustrates the method by which this notion was created. \"Justices in the Bedroom\" in Chapter Five was a standout as well, but most topical was Chapter Ten, \"Silencing Political Debate.\" To what extent does McCain-Feingold erode our liberties? Right now it's hard to say. I agree with the author that advertising is speech, and the recent letter Obama sent to the Justice Department concerning the William Ayers ad put out by a 527 organization is an example of how the left will take advantage of any loophole as a means to silence their critics. Overall, we are not as free as we used to be and Mark Levin's Men in Black illustrates why this is the case.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A3JPFWKS83R49V", "ProductID": "B000X16Q5O", "Review": "Constitutional Concerns, or Politics as Usual? Men in Black is a book about excessive government power. It isn't concerned so much with legislative or executive power. Rather, this is a book about the growing power and influence of the Supreme Court; a court that author Mark Levin feels has overstepped its boundaries and taken upon itself to write the law in its own terms, often against the will of the people.\n\nLevin speaks with authority on the issue of Supreme Court responsibility and the division of power among the three branches of the U.S. government. He is a Constitutional lawyer so he is certainly qualified to write a book such as this. However, this book doesn't necessarily present the strongest case against Supreme Court authority and abuse of power and many of its arguments are weak and sometimes contradictory. One of the arguments the author makes throughout the book, for example, is that a law that has been voted into place by the people should almost always stand; without interference from the Supreme Court or any other court trying to overturn it. But what this type of argument fails to point out is that, since the United States was founded as a Republic form of government, the rights of all people- majority, minority, and otherwise- must be respected and upheld. Rights are not up for a vote, but based on Levin's reasoning, he seems to think it's okay to take away certain rights if the ballot results say so.\n\nLevin also argues against other things that many American's cherish, like the right to privacy. True, there is no explicit right to privacy granted in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean it isn't an implied right, intended by the nation's founders. Surveys show that the majority of Americans feel that privacy is a right and should be Constitutionally protected. Levin feels it is not a right and that the Supreme Court should not treat it as such. It's interesting how the book so Levin so quickly changes his position on democracy and the importance of upholding the will of the people when they vote something into law. If a vote of the people confirms the right to privacy, one would think that someone like Levin would agree that it should be made into law. But based on his other convictions in this book, he would likely be against it, in direct contradiction of some of his other stands on the issues and the Supreme Court's authority to decide them.\n\nIn spite of Men In Black's faulty reasoning, there are some parts worth reading. The best chapter (by far) is chapter 10, \"Silencing Political Debate\". Here, the book accurately points out the very unconstitutional and un- American McCain- Feingold act of 2002 and how it silences free speech by making it a crime to talk about politicians in the days leading up to an election. How this ever became law and survived a review by the Supreme Court, I will never know. Levin is one- hundred percent correct in his criticism of this act and I share his disgust. Besides this chapter, there are some other good points made regarding certain individual laws (many are mentioned in the book) from over the years and how their fate was decided by the Supreme Court and they also make for good reading.\n\nOverall, however, Men in Black isn't quite the incredible work of constitutional writing that some of its endorsers claim. Mark Levin seems upset at the Supreme Court more for the trend toward more liberal thinking than for its supposed violations of the U.S. Constitution. If the Supreme Court was violating the Constitution in favor of a position that he and his fellow conservatives approve, then I doubt he would say anything about it. He also seems to believe that the will of the people is sufficient to trample on rights. It all adds up to a less than average book that fails to convince me of its initial premise: That the U.S. Supreme Court has excessive power and wields too much influence. It's a nice effort, but it doesn't quite convince.", "Feedback": "negative"}

{"ReviewerID": "AKYNIMNI8LOBP", "ProductID": "B000X16Q5O", "Review": "some of the usual faulty rhetoric Mark Levin's book falls into some of the usual pitfalls that almost all biased political argumentation today falls into--evidence is often stretched and recontextualized to fit certain predisposed conclusions.  The book is clearly well researched, and Levin is no doubt quite knowledgeable about legal process and the language of the US Constitution, but his conclusions are often stretched to a degree that no longer fits the evidence.  I would hesitate comparing his method to a smokescreen, for I am not entirely sure if Levin is purposefully making exaggerated claims that he doesn't support but artfully disguises in the ethos of research, but at the core of many of his ideas are assumptions or basic contradictions that he just can't back up.\n\nFor example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.\n\nLevin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.\n\nLevin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.\n\nIn the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side.", "Feedback": "negative"}

Mark Levin, an excellent example of zealous advocate for his particular view serves as a fine case in point.  For most people it seems that the epithet activist merely means the court does something that the particular person does not like.  Thus Levin defines the court as activist when it strikes down flag burning laws based on the first amendment and just as quickly brands the court with the same term when it fails to over turn the McCain-Feingold campaign finance system on the same basis.\n\nProfessor Levin, like ideological advocates on both sides, shed great heat but little light on the issue of the court.  Citizens as a whole would be better served by arguments that laid out a philosophical basis under which they believed the court should strike down laws, rather than simply presenting case by case arguments which rest mostly on how one feels about the particular case.  Generally, one would expect conservatives to be extremely circumspect when it comes to overturning the \"popular will\" (a legislative action) and narrowly construe their own authority.  Yet interestingly, those considered conservative on the current court in the tally at the end of every session prove themselves more inclined to strike down laws put in place by the people's representatives than do their \"liberal\" colleagues.  Does this make them activists? Levin does not think so, primarily because he agrees with their decisions.\n\nGiven the many attacks against originalists like the author, one would have expected a better refutation of his opponent's arguments.  Professor Levin ascribes to a theory that judges must interpret laws based on the understanding of the drafters who framed them, thus the \"original\" intent.  Yet here we find fine fodder for those who argue that originalists only look to such history when it suits their particular current position.  Thus, conservatives like Levin claim the 14th Amendment voids affirmative action schemes, yet fail to consider that the same post Civil War congress that passed the 14th also passed legislation creating various affirmative action programs to assist African American citizens.  Since one can hardly imagine a congress passing an Amendment and then passing legislation that directly violates their intent, one must believe that they saw the 14th Amendment as consistent with such programs.\n\nSuch zealous advocacy no doubt serves professor Levin well as a lawyer, but it does little to aid the understanding of his readers.  The Supreme Court remains a powerful and complex organization and perhaps the least well understood by the citizenry.

{"ReviewerID": "A3O2RCKAMSE9X7", "ProductID": "B000X16Q5O", "Review": "The Supreme Court: The Left Tide Is Turning In MEN IN BLACK, Mark Levin, the conservative radio talk host, turns his attention to an area of Americana that has suddenly shifted gears from dry and dusty to hot and relevant.  He notes that the Supreme Court forms one angle of the triangle that in effect governs America.  The Presidency and the Senate over the years have struggled with the Supreme Court and each other in a bear hug that historically was more or less even.  However, Levin notes that the Court has grown powerful beyond the scope envisioned for it by the Founding Fathers, who set it up as a check on the other two.  The Court, they held, was to interpret the law, a formidably strong enough concept indeed.  Yet, Levin accuses the Court of overstepping its bounds in a manner that places it squarely in the camp of a leftist ideology that he fears has turned the United States into a bizarre nation that opposes nearly every precept once held dearly by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.  No longer is the America of 2005 a nation that opposes racism (affirmative action is the \"settled law\" of a racist ideology that the Founding Fathers would have found abhorrent) nor is it one that will protect its citizens from foreign incursions (the Court now insists that captured Islamofascist terrorists must be accorded the constitutional right to face their accusers in a court of law).  Levin argues that the Court has proven over the last fifty years that the fate of the Democratic party and the fate of the Court itself are inextricably intertwined.  MEN IN BLACK was written before the recent arrival of John Roberts as Chief Justice.  With the looming confirmation hearings of Samuel Alitto as the newest conservative justice, Levin must be heartened by the likely prospect of a reversal of a court that has looked over its left shoulder for so long that it forgot that it even had a right one.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2V3P1XE33NYC3", "ProductID": "B000X16Q5O", "Review": "Activist judges destabilize the country Lawyer and conservative talk show host Mark Levin has written an admirable and long overdue book with \"Men In Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America.\" We've had books about overreaching presidents and an out of control Congress, so why not level our sights at the Supreme Court of the United States? Anyone with half a brain knows a number of justices sitting on that body possess a most unusual view on how the Constitution ought to work. And increasingly, ideology seems to have little to do with the madness that passes for legal reasoning in those hallowed chambers. We need to look no further than the recent Kelo decision, in which the high court declared constitutional the right of government to seize private property in order to pass it on to non-public developers. Both liberals and conservatives exploded with real anger over this ruling. Eminent domain always allowed the government to take property, with just compensation of course, for important public uses. But now we've got a court that says if a company or other economic concern can pay more taxes on a piece of land, thus providing more income for the government, then poorer citizens need to clear off. Another nail in America's coffin!\n\nLevin's book goes far beyond Kelo--which wasn't decided by the time the book went to press, sadly--to expose a pattern of extraconstitutional shenanigans that's been going on for years. Right from the start, the author gives us an example of what he sees as a central problem in the court's functioning. We all know that justices, when confirmed by the Senate, serve for as long as they wish. What happens when a member stays on the court for so long that health issues cripple their ability to adjudicate cases? Nothing, really. Levin gives us a list of justices who went insane, fell ill with dementia, or otherwise suffered an affliction that hampered their intellectual faculties. They remained on the bench. Moreover, what should we do about justices who no longer express much of an interest in doing their jobs? According to \"Men in Black,\" this has actually happened. Thurgood Marshall spent most of his last years on the court ignoring briefings in favor of a heavy diet of soap operas in his private chambers. Congress may impeach justices at all levels of the federal judiciary for various criminal offenses, a power they haven't invoked in ages, but incapacitation due to illness or boredom seems beyond their purview.\n\nThe bulk of Levin's book outlines specific topics and the cases associated with them. In nearly every instance, the doctrine (it's now been around for so long that it's essentially a doctrine) of judicial activism rears its ugly head again and again. Levin calls the Dred Scott case, in which the high court denied citizenship to blacks, an egregious example of activist law. The Korematsu decision, in which the justices upheld the government's right to intern Japanese-Americans during the war, is another case mentioned here. Separation of Church and State? A bedrock principle laid out in the Bill of Rights, and one the founders intended to keep government out of the business of sanctioning state religions, has now been used by activist courts to drive religion out of the public sphere entirely. In issues as important and diverse as immigration, freedom of speech, race relations, elections, and citizenship rights the Supreme Court has either invented rights out of thin air or stretched pre-existing language in the Constitution to impose their own views on American Society. The most contentious social issue of modern times, abortion and Roe v. Wade, eventually came about because the high court created a right to privacy back in the 1960s.\n\nI liked the book, but I would because I'm a conservative. Most judicial activists seem to subscribe to liberalism. Levin takes this view as well, and it's tough to argue with him. Conservatives wouldn't support affirmative action, which is essentially state sanctioned discrimination, nor would they condone expanding rights enjoyed by citizens to non-citizens. Yet we have laws upheld by the Supreme Court that do these very things. We've got laws that have turned the Commerce Clause into a means of allowing the federal government to regulate intrastate activities. I won't go as far as Levin does and blame the court entirely for these problems, since institutions and lobbying groups leave their fingerprints all over some of these laws long before they find their way to the Supreme Court, but no where is it written that the justices have to uphold this nonsense or take advantage of the situation to create entirely new laws and rights. I wish the author underscored this point better. I also wish he would have talked about precedent, a big topic today. Liberals scream about precedent because they want to protect Roe v. Wade, arguing that it can't be overturned because it's \"settled law.\" By that reasoning we shouldn't have overturned Plessy v. Ferguson or Korematsu, right?\n\n\"Men In Black\" couldn't be a timelier read. With President Bush gaining the opportunity to appoint two new justices to the Supreme Court, and the possibility of another appointment if Justice Stevens retires in the next couple of years (he's 85 now), the high court could go through a radical re-alignment that may last for decades. Millions of us hope and pray this happens. It's long past time to roll back the radicalism that marks the Supreme Court's jurisprudence of the last three decades in favor of more originalist readings that will return stability to the nation's legal system. If you're planning on watching the upcoming Senate hearings on Bush's latest appointment (Notice I'm not saying it will be Harriet Miers; she looks like she's in big trouble), reading this book will give you a good background on many of the questions and topics that will likely arise.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The mechanics of the court system are not, for most people, comprehensible, much less exciting.

The problem of \"Men In Blsck\" lies in Levin's adoption of certain cases and movements as evidence. For example, Levin chastises the  Court for holding that burning the American flag is protected under the First Amendment. Well, I consider myself a conservative - and I agree with the Court. There are simply some issues that resonable people can disagree on, but Levin doesn't seem to allow that latitude. This is regrettable, because generally Levin's arguments are strong. Likewise, Levin allows himself to get wrapped up in Roe v. Wade and the entire abortion issue. There are many people, like myself, who believe that the legal reasoning in Row v. Wade is lacking, if not entirely non-existent. Yet it is possible at the same time for even conservatives to believe the ultimate holding is correct. In fact, I know that I am not alone in believing that abortion does constitute the taking of a human life, but that government has absolutely no right to dictate what a woman may do with regard to her own body. In other words, Roe v. Wade is simply not a good way to illustrate the truth of Levin's theme that \"the Supreme Court is destroying America.\" It is: but Roe v. Wade is not likely to get the majority of people to agree with that premise.\n\n  As I said, I wish I could offer \"Men In Black\" higher praise, but I think Levin picked the wrong way to illustrate by choosing polarizing examples.

Many judges at all levels operate with no regard for the Constitution or the limits on their power.  A very recent example is the district court judge in the Schiavo case who ignored Congress and the president when they asked for a review of the case.\n\nAlthough the framers of our Constitution did a great job at putting checks on Congress and the president, they didn't do as well in restraints on the courts.  This Constitutional `Achilles heel' has allowed the judiciary in general, and the Supreme Court in particular, to function as an oligarchy.  Five unelected, unaccountable justices on the Supreme Court have usurped power to the point that they can essentially dictate policy to the nation.\n\nLevin does a very good job of showing many areas where this has occurred including citing specific cases and providing hundreds of footnotes.  Some areas where the Court has acted outside the scope of its authority that Levin lists include the following:  Forcing tax money to be spent on services for illegal aliens, allowing political speech to be limited, interfering with local school operations, farm quotas, prison policies, partial birth abortion, etc.  He demonstrates how the Court has usurped authority rightly belonging to the states, Congress, and the Executive.\n\nI don't think that he puts enough blame on the Congress and President for allowing this to happen.  They certainly have had remedies available, but have failed to exercise them effectively.\n\nAnother thing that Mr. Levin does very well is making it clear that these judges who usurp power have no more wisdom than anyone else and sadly, in many cases, far less.  He goes through some of the horrendous decisions of the Court such as Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, and the the McCain-Feingold Act.\n\nHe also provides several examples of justices who stayed in power after they seemingly had dementia issues or otherwise didn't fulfill their duties appropriately.  In addition, he reviews the likes of former justices like Hugo (KKK) Black and Felix Frankfurter (who aided the career of notorious spy Alger Hiss).\n\nThere are issues in the book with which I disagree with Mr. Levin.  For example, he seemed to be contradictory in his commentary on Korematsu v. U.S.  A main contention of the book is the problems with judicial activism and the Court not deferring to the Executive in areas in which it should.  Then he cited Korematsu, which was essentially a case where the Court did defer to FDR regarding the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during WWII.  I think that internment was terrible, but I do not think that this decision was judicial activism.  It certainly seemed to be a case of deferring to the Executive.\n\nAlthough Levin does a very good job of outlining the problems with the courts (or as the book's subtitle is `How the Supreme Court is Destroying America'), the best part of the book is the section that contains his proposed solutions.  He has cited some that are already available to Congress and the president such as limiting the jurisdiction of the courts in certain areas, impeachment, and recess appointments.  Additionally, he has suggested Constitutional amendments allowing a Congressional override of Supreme Court decisions with a 2/3 vote of Congress and limiting the terms of federal judges to twelve years.  For those who want to be able to keep a particularly outstanding judge, he suggests making them eligible to be reappointed after the twelve year period if they can again win Senate confirmation.\n\nThis is a very important and much needed book.

First, he equates judicial activism with non-originalist interpretation--yet many of the Court's supposed judicial \"originalists\" [Scalia, Rehnquist, Thomas] have been extremely activist in utilizing Court power as witness the 2000 election decisions. Second, much of the initial chapters is devoted to Levin simply ticking off various Supreme Court decisions which he considers to be subversive, crazy or both. Some of these decisions do certainly qualify as \"self-inflected wounds\" to be sure, but this approach becomes a bit tiresome. Things pick up, however, later with very strong chapters on immigration, the commerce clause, state power and other topics. It is clear that, to the extent Levin represents the \"Federalist Society\" point of view, Justice Kennedy has become a prime target of criticism, as to a lesser extent has Sanda Day O'Conner due to their \"lapses\" in upholding conservative interpretations of the Constitution in key cases. To his credit, Levin criticizes both the Florida Supreme Court (extensively) and the U.S. Supreme Court (a bit) relative to the 2000 election decisions. One of the most interesting and valuable sections of the book is Levin's focus on \"liberal\" interest groups hooking up with supporters on the Hill to try and frustrate conservative judicial nominations.  He includes as an appendix various memos exchanged between interest groups and Senate staffers which are quite interesting to read.  While they are, hardly, as shocking as Levin suggests, nonetheless they are quite fascinating--especially given the upcoming warfare that will ensue when President Bush nominates a Justice or Chief Justice.  All told, a good solid read that stimulates the adrenalin.", "Feedback": "positive"}

The definition of conserve is \"to protect from loss or harm,\" and the author is trying his best to argue that the Supreme Court today is causing loss and harm to a quaint old document we call the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Levin makes no bones about rolling back the clock and taking government back from these appointed dictators who have given themselves the power to change the Constitution by a simple majority vote. But even liberals can be conservative about some things, and vice versa, and Levin makes the stark point that if we ignore this problem and wait for someone else to do something about it, we'll one day wake up in a country the founders would have taken up arms to overthrow!\n\nTo those who read this book and think the balance of powers between the three branches of government is how it should be, congratulate yourselves for helping to pave the road ahead to fascism. In fact, this book is so conservative in wanting to preserve the original intent of the founders, that were they here today, all of them -- even Hamilton -- would strongly endorse what Levin has written. It's the clarion call to resistance, and Democrats and Rempublicans would do well to heed this warning, because if it's not read now, it will certainly be read by future generations studying the fall of the United States.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "AUHG8KSHI529U", "ProductID": "B000X16Q5O", "Review": "It is time to stop judicial subversion of the Constitution Mark Levin, who worked in the justice department of the Regan administration, does a real service for us by reviewing not only a few of the colorful men and women who have served on the court, but also the evolution of judicial review and the way politics has superceded the Constitution in many of the Court's decisions.  The fact is that we have a written Constitution and a process for changing the Constitution to prevent the kind of power grab the courts have made in recent decades.  Yet, because of the abdication of the legislative branch and, to a lesser extent, the executive, the courts today reign and rule.\n\nFor more than a generation the public has been mis-educated about the facts and meaning of Marbury v. Madison.  It is time to insist on a public discourse on these matters in order to put the role of the courts into a proper perspective.  This may seem like a change, since everyone living has been taught that the courts have the final say in our government.  This was not so prior to the mid-twentieth century and was never the intent of our Founders.\n\nOnce we see the Justices and judges for what they are and compare that to what they are supposed to be, we can begin removing the powers they should never have had.  We need to expend unceasing energy placing them back into their proper role and requiring them to uphold the oath each of them took to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe author rightly focuses on current debates, only going back in history to provide context.  If Mr. Levin had included all the abuses of the Judiciary, the book would have had to be presented in multiple volumes.  He discusses the current debate in U.S. Courts about using opinions from FOREIGN courts and policies from NGOs in deciding cases.  This is so absurd that it is hard to take seriously how frightening and dangerous this trend really is.  This book helps every reader understand the reality and threat of this very clearly.\n\nMr. Levin also takes us through the follies and convolutions of judiciary thought on the continuing banishment of God from public discourse through judicial fiat, the manufacturing of privacy rights (only sometimes) to support abortion, the torturing of the 14th amendment in order to support (selective) reverse discrimination, providing rights for non-citizens and terrorists.  He recounts only some of the more egregious social policies legislated by a judiciary that sees itself as more socially advanced than the insufferable populace and their state legislatures.\n\nRemember, this is all much less about whether or not this or that policy is correct or not, or needed or not.  It is about the way the policy is being implemented, legislated, imposed by judges.  That was never their intended or rightful role in our government.  Our government is certainly amenable to change.  However, it is change brought about by persuasion of our fellow Citizens and mutually changing the laws.  Not by some small number of beings who deign impose their enlightened and more evolved views on us the benighted.  That is the very tyranny we threw off to claim our freedom.  We need to remember that and reorder our government to its proper balance.\n\nI particularly liked Mr. Levin's clear and forceful discussion of the curtailing of our first amendment free speech rights by our legislature (to protect incumbents) with the support of laughable court decisions.  Well, laughable if they weren't so tragic to the health of our public discourse.\n\nWe do need a broad public discourse on this and continue to demand of our legislatures that they honor their oath to protect and defend the entire constitution.  They should not only reign in their own political use of the judiciary to get what they failed to win at the ballot box, but they should be aggressive in putting the entire judiciary back in its place.\n\nNewt Gingrich's \"Winning the Future\" has a great discussion of this process as well.\n\nIf you want to read a more complete treatment of Judicial Review - Judicial Supremacy, I encourage you to read \"The People Themselves\" which provides a complete and scholarly, yet very readable, discussion of this vital topic.\n\nPlease, read this book and talk about it with everyone you know.  And don't be afraid to write your state and US representatives in order to make your views known on this most important issue.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A13E0ARAXI6KJW", "ProductID": "B000X16Q5O", "Review": "The Supreme Court as an Abusive Power Base...Credible? It's not such earth-shattering news that there is something awry about the precarious checks and balances upon which the three branches of the U.S. government are designed to keep an eye on each other. Author Mark Levin takes on the Supreme Court with emotional gusto and portrays the judicial arm of the government as a tyranny of monopolistic power threatening the very foundation of our constitution. He sees the Court evolving into a legislative agency rather than fulfilling its intended role as the interpreter of the laws. It's an intriguing premise to take a peek behind the black robes (though not as funny as the nude centerfolds of the justices in Jon Stewart's \"America: The Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction\") but one often caught in hyperbole, no surprise since Levin is by profession, a talk show host who mistakes such tactics as passionate discourse.\n\nTo his credit, the author does bear the weight of thoughtful research when he looks, for example, at the Supreme Court's willingness to abrogate the First Amendment through upholding the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. He provides some compelling evidence of how the Court has overstepped its bounds on many occasions, in particular, by expanding the power of the federal government vis--vis several states to enforce certain rulings. The author feels this encroaching sense of power has ignited issues such as abortion, immigration, civil rights for terrorists, religious liberty, affirmative action, pornography and election law, beyond what would have made sense within the Constitution's framework.  But the stacked deck approach he takes, dubbing the Court \"radicals in robes\", seems to oversimplify what he feels are the justices' directive to impose their policy preferences on society.  Levin should be commended for undertaking such a worthy effort with such vigor, and I have to give credit to him for explaining why certain cases should not have happened in light of what the Constitution says. I just wish he spent less time on what he perceives to be the problem with the current Court and more time on what he feels should remedy it. The book could have resonated with me much more if he was more solution-driven in his approach.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Losing hope and not caring if he lives or dies, he's surprised when someone finally comes forward to clear his name. Unbeknownst to him while incarcerated he's accrued a wife, a woman he's sure is inline with his thieving aunt and cousin. Jessie is an innocent pawn in the lunacy of her stepfather. Marrying a man she thought knew of their arrangement, she's unprepared for his disbelief and anger. Jessie made sure at least his family fortune wasn't ravished in the same way his home has been, but feels all her efforts will be in vain due to the lord's dependency on drugs and alcohol. An unlikely pair will have to overcome the torment that comes when your mind and body are ensnared by chemical enslavement.\n\nI think sometimes modern individuals forget drugs have been an issue for hundreds of years. The Viscount's Addiction is a prime example of how even the strongest of spirits can be broken when hopelessness occurs. Jessie and Ryder are both victims of their circumstances but while Ryder has decided to drown in his sorrows Jessie has taken her situation and maintained not only her physical innocence but her morality.

When Jessie comes into the picture, their chemistry explodes and the sex is off the charts hot.

Subjected to daily beatings and corpses left to rot within the cells, it's no wonder he becomes addicted to the opium. As the story unfolds we realize the opium benefactor is non other than his uncle- part of his plan to secure Lord Blackwoods estate while he is incarcerated.\n\nUpon his release and return to the estate, he is introduced to Jesse-his uncle Hentry's step-daughter and ward from the time she was 15. It is revealed that at that age he had her and sign a proxy marriage certificate to Ryder(Lord Blackwood)-so that Henry and his son Lewis could live off the estate while Ryder is away legally. Of course this makes Jesse Ryder's wife-legally.\n\nRyder's immediate reaction is to assume all 3 have swindled him and from the looks of his estate impoverished him as well. As punishment he kicks out his cousin Lewis and tells Jesse he will be taking advantage of his marital rights-she will also have 30 days in his bed before she will be in prison with the others. She protests her innocence in the whole affair and tries to show him she was taking care of things the best she could. Opium, Laudnum and alcohol are never far from his reach, making it difficult for him to really see things clearly. He does not trust her and she is falling in love with him. When she starts actually making references to her absence in 30 days-he starts to feel he would rather not lose her and asks her to stay and help rid him of his addiction. (Could he be starting to care for this woman who lied and cheated her way into his life?) This woman -in whose arms he can forget the withdrawls for a while...............\nWhen she agrees-she starts to realise a few things herself-She is in love with this very bad-boy sexually- aggressive Viscount and much to her dismay-when his addiction is over-He will be a different Man &---so he will surely end their coerced marriage.\n\nThe story is fluid, chatty , sensual, naughty and every scene is well set up for our passionate couple. Scottie's version of recovery from Opium spared some of the more brutal sides of addiction and I am actually glad to get more of the relationship story instead.

{"ReviewerID": "A230ZS8F6I0AGM", "ProductID": "B000XU4SQO", "Review": "Important  - it  makes you look... Like many others, I've always been fascinated by the story of Eva Braun, but (maybe because I'm Jewish) was also afraid to really take a good look.  It's part of a horrifying story for a Jew, but I was drawn to this book specifically because it purported to be a \"fictionalized\" version of a (probably mostly) true story.  That kind of made it more neutral for me.  What I didn't expect was to come away with some sympathy for Eva; the author revealed aspects of her life with Hitler that show her to be something of a victim and a prisoner herself.  After all, once involved with this monster, she was not able to be free; she couldn't even leave her home alone, ever - she was always under guard.  And the author also brings up the fact that Hitler wouldn't marry her publicly...she was always described as his \"friend\" or his \"secretary.\"  In that time, in Europe, it was something of a disgrace to be a mistress, with no hope of marrying the man who had ruined your reputation.  So that Eva was placed in a humiliating position.  In  other words, this is as much a feminist novel as one about an evil society (which it also is; very, very subtly elaborated as the story unfolds). Another surprise was to find that I identified with Eva in some respects.  For example, the author describes her as a \"fashion addict,\" a shopaholic; all she ever thought about was what she would wear next.  And Eva would often change her clothing several times a day.  This vanity - this character defect  of  placing appearances above other values - is found among women everywhere, trained to use appearance to compete for men's attentions.  Eva is depicted as shallow and uninterested in anything other than being Hitler's lap dog.  This made her an object of scorn in the novel - but also a forgiveable, if weak, type of woman common to every culture.  I found myself unable to put the book down, and I admired the writing, which was, as one reviewer said, perfectly \"creepy\" - as if the storyteller were whispering a horror tale.  There are many insights about the times, the protagonists, including Hitler, Eva and Hitler's stooges.  As another reviewer has mentioned, one thinks about this book long after putting it down.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A1L43KWWR05PCS", "ProductID": "B000XU4SXC", "Review": "PUTTING THE SADDLE ON THE RIGHT HORSE... This is a compelling, well-researched work of historical fiction. The linchpin of the story is John D. Lee, a close personal friend of Brigham Young and a charismatic Mormon leader, who was tried and convicted  twenty years after the fact for the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which over a hundred, non-Mormon immigrants to the West were slaughtered by Mormon settlers with the possible help of their Native-American allies.\n\nThe reader views John D. Lee through the eyes of three of his many,  wives, Emma, his English bride, Ann, his thirteen year old child bride, and Rachel, his second wife, sister to his first wife. Told in three parts, each wife has her own distinct voice and personality. Each one presents her own perspective on life with John D. Lee and the effect that he had on each of their lives  and how they each responded to his eventual disgrace.\n\nIt is a wonderful story of three women, each trying to come to terms with life and its vicissitudes, given their own needs, desires, and circumstances, as well as the nature of the time in which they lived.  It is also a birds-eye view into frontier life in a polygamous household, at a time in which this doctrine was the status quo for Mormonism.\n\nThis is a well-written book, as engrossing as it is fascinating, taking the reader into a world that is foreign to most of us. It is a story about real women in a time that, to the modern reader, seems almost surreal.

Instead you will read much about (what the author portrays as) a sexually obsessed family and the need for their husband's approval.  It was interesting, although again I will say, not at all what I expected.

{"ReviewerID": "AKYNIMNI8LOBP", "ProductID": "B000XU4TU4", "Review": "I almost hate myself for this review I have no doubt that Charles Baxter will be noted as one of our most thoughtful and philosophic American writers of this time period.  He has moved impressively from short story collections (my experience with his work started with _A Relative Stranger_) to a full-blown novelist.  Even from his first novel, _First Light_, Baxter has shown a great mixture of a kind of old-school character depth, with high school teachers able to discuss railroad companies and quote classics in normal conversation, mixed in with a clearly modern sense of the world.  His characters remind me somewhat of people who occupy Tony Hoagland poems--people who seem to be stuck in a netherworld of intelligentsia and down-home simplicity.  _The Feast of Love_ was a good choice as a finalist for an NBA--perhaps it should have won, but I haven't yet read the competition and winner.\n\nBut this novel doesn't ring out like other works, and it seems to spend too long mulling about with little engagement.  I almost regret saying these things, and almost feel that I need to rethink my priorities, that maybe I've become a jaded or oversimplified reader, for I very nearly put down this book after about forty pages because I was feeling that Baxter was a little more invested in the young couple that is the primary focus of this book than he was able to convey to me.\n\nTo tell the truth, the only thing that really brought me back to this book to gut it out and read through the rest is that the back cover promised some violence, something I would not have predicted from my initial experience in the reading.\n\nNow I really feel ashamed.  Baxter is such a wonderful writer, who is able to take the oft-used gimmick of quirkiness and use it to his advantage.  Usually, his characters engage me me solely for their oddities that bring out their humanity rather than display their eccentricities.  But even with the promised violence of this book, I remained unengaged to the end.\n\nI think Baxter is a wonderful writer.  Really.  And it is the truly fantastic writer who gets the job done, who finishes a work even though lightning hasn't struck yet and do his job and get his efforts out there into the world.\n\nBut unfortunately, this one just wasn't one of his best efforts.  But I shouldn't be the one to talk--after all, HE is the one who later put out _The Feast of Love_ and very nearly got one of the big prizes, and I just sit here typing this review.", "Feedback": "negative"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2F6N60Z96CAJI", "ProductID": "B000XU4TU4", "Review": "A \"hard to put down\" book whose characters will draw you in Charles Baxter's new novel, SAUL AND PATSY, may be the longest short story ever written.\nBased on two of his previous stories --- \"Saul and Patsy are Getting Comfortable in Michigan\" from THROUGH THE SAFETY NET and \"Saul and Patsy are Pregnant\" from A RELATIVE STRANGER --- the novel greatly expounds the title characters' lives and further explores themes of irony and sentimentality across more than 300 pages, yet by virtue of its vivid characters, incredibly targeted prose and insights into married life, SAUL AND PATSY asks to be read like a short story --- in one sitting. It lacks any suspense, but it is still hard to put down. And reading that last page is akin to saying good-bye to old college friends, who stopped by for an all-too-short visit.\nSaul Bernstein, a Jewish history teacher originally from Baltimore, and Patsy Carlson, a dancer from Chicago, have recently moved to the town of Five Oaks, Michigan --- one of the many \"dusty, luckless midwestern cities tucked away inside the folds of the map\" --- out of Saul's youthful idealism: he wants to bring high education to the plains of rural America, to reverse the simpleness of middle-class life. It's an unrealistic, outsized, almost elitist dream, but it's also one of the few things about which he feels sincerely. Yet, as a well-educated Jew in a small midwestern town, he feels hopelessly out of place and unable to relate to his students or even his neighbors.\nFor the novel's first chapter, Baxter reworks and updates \"Saul and Patsy Are Getting Comfortable in Michigan,\" which ended with an ambiguous car crash, leaving readers with no sign of whether or not the couple survived. In fact, they walk away more or less unscathed to build a home together and begin a family, gradually growing increasingly, if not perfectly, comfortable in their adopted hometown.\nWhen Saul is assigned to teach a remedial writing course, a student named Gordy Himmelman develops an odd fixation on him and Patsy, yet his intentions are unknowable, his motivation a mystery. \"On Gordy, blankness had a certain eloquence,\" Baxter writes. \"The boy was profoundly blank.\" Yet he passively propels the novel's minimal plot, first as a curious stalker who stands under a tree in their front yard for hours at a time, then as a ghost who inspires rebellion in the town's susceptible teenagers.\nAs this story unfolds, Baxter also introduces us to Saul and Patsy's friends and neighbors --- the McPhees, a couple just out of high school who seem to thrive on \"midwestern earnestness\"; Saul's widowed mother, who has a scandalous affair with a younger man; and his handsome brother Howie, a tech millionaire whose life may not be as blessed as Saul assumes.\nAll of these characters pop in and out of Saul and Patsy's life, but the one thing that remains constant is its setting. SAUL AND PATSY is a Midwestern pastoral: Baxter evokes a Michigan whose flatness holds a \"sensual loneliness\" and whose cities are losing their personalities through the ups and downs of the industries that created them. Like Terre Haute, Duluth, Flint, Grand Forks, or dozens of other similar --- and actual --- municipalities, Five Oaks is one of those \"cities you had heard of but couldn't quite picture, cities that called nothing in particular to mind except for an eagerness to be larger and more prosperous than they were, and an all-consuming late-stage boosterism that was mostly insecurity and worry masked by bluster.\" Even as Saul and Patsy get comfortable in Michigan, Michigan is becoming an increasingly uncomfortable place to live.\nEven though he intends this novel to register on a state and even regional level, Baxter maintains the story's focus on its title characters and on their \"plain old married love.\" It has an amiably small, domestic scope, which certainly is no limitation, especially in the hands of a writer who is as fearlessly playful and fiercely intelligent as Baxter. Rather, SAUL AND PATSY is wonderfully and magically life-size.\n  --- Reviewed by Stephen M. Deusner", "Feedback": "positive"}

I saw this title and thought it would make an excellent gift for my neighbor who recently launched a business. Since I am also a long time student of behavior change, I also ordered a copy of the book for myself. And I am glad I did.\n\nThis book adds to the chorus of books and research which emphasizes that our state of mind, rather than any particular strategy, determines our level of success. This was a key learning for the author from her interviews with the six-figure women. The messy, internal work that needs to be done is the authors initial focus in this book.\n\nFrom there, the author goes on to describe the nine traits of underearners. She then contrasts these traits with the traits she observed in the six-figure women. The author then goes on to lay out seven strategies she found the six-figure women to employ in various combinations.\n\nFrom my perspective, the key concept in this book is that wealth building, (not just money, requires a two prong approach: inner work and outer work. Wealth building tactics and strategies are not likely to work without the inner work (addressing thoughts, feelings, beliefs and values) being done as well.\n\nI found this book to be an easy, engaging read. A big plus in the book is the quizzes, exercises and other tools that accompany the text. An Appendix that includes additional resources, tips and a book group discussion guide is another plus as well.\n\nIf one of your life goals is to build wealth, this book should definitely be on your must read list.

It is easy to read and very thought provoking.  While many of the ideas and strategies seem like common sense, a few of the strategies are ideas that women (and mean) can benefit from employing no matter what their career and salary level.  I enjoyed this book and gained a lot of insight.\nOne of the strategies that especially caught my eye, called \"The Trap\", was given the motto \"bite off more than you can chew, but not so much you choke.\"  This idea involved stretching yourself but not too thin and also emphasized that some women can be too hard on themselves, extremely impatient or overly meticulous.  This dealt with taking some risk and possibly get in over your head and not realizing you need to cut yourself some slack and instead pushing even harder until you snap.  The author used many interviewees comments and experiences as well as her known to clearly illustrate both the danger and the handling of \"The Trap\".\nThe bottom line of these strategies is that it is not what type of career you pick (all different fields from musicians and artists to CEO were represented), what company you work for (or not), what your education or your background is, but how you use your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual strengths and improve them by following the laid out strategies that will determine whether you can be a \"six-figure woman\" or man.", "Feedback": "positive"}

A young female scholar, who we soon discover may be slightly crazy and full of secrets her self, writes a mysterious letter to the aforementioned author and though we don't know what the letter says, we do know that it is compelling enough to cause its recipient to fly halfway around the world to meet with (and confront) its author.\n  While Banville is undoubtedly a talented author, and his writing- heavy on description, light on conversation, at times poetic in its fluidity- is worth the price of admission alone, the story he has concocted for \"Shroud\" amounts to nothing more than an over-hyped secret and the not-too-exciting results of its revealing.  What that secret is will remain a secret (don't want to give too much away), but sadly, that secret fails to live up to its early hype (even the title references the secret and its centrality to the story), and thus the book's success relies on the strength of its main characters (neither of whom are all that likeable) and Banville's writing talent.  In this instance, unfortunately, this talent is not enough to redeem the story.\n  \"Shroud\" is a good book, written by a talented author, who unfortunately does not strike gold mining territory that has been often mined before.  Nothing new here, and at least for this reader, this is exactly what makes this book solid but ultimately forgettable.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

I have finally discovered a work by Banville that I would NOT recommend to anyone save, perhaps, to some castaway, starved for anything approaching true literature, living in some outback town, relying completely for his/her reading material on the sparsely-shelved public library in which the only Banville work is Shroud.\n\nIndeed, in so many ways, this work is resembles nothing so much as a train wreck of two other Banvillean works, Athena and The Untouchable, both of which I would recommend with highest laud (a good, Banvillean word, that).  In point of fact, I have done so in my reviews of these two masterworks.\n\nLet's take this theme of identity (or lack thereof):  The narrator of The Untouchable explores this evanescent notion much more deftly and seductively than herein, where it is pounded into the reader's cranium on page after page, rendering \"heavy-handed\" something of an understatement.  All which illustrates that it's the Proustian style, not the Nietzschean, which best broaches this subject.\n\nThen, of course, there's sex, and plenty of it herein:  In Athena, the oneiric aura of the narrator's love/lust for his beloved is manifest in every raindrop, every turn of the street and, indeed, in every one of the paintings he elaborates on - Again, that deft, Banvillean touch - Here, to the contrary, we have detailed, emetic grotesqueries of the paedophilic narrator (whatever his name may be), inserting his phallus into women whom he desires or who, in their turn, desire to be, \"ripped in two\" by him.\n\nSorry, it's just not on.  Yes, yes Banville's still a wizard with the English language.  But even this quality, as opposed to his other works, is not up to the Banvillean mark here.  I almost always have a quote or entire passage that I feel bound to include in my reviews of Banville's works, so rapturous are they.  Not so here, and I've read the book twice.\n\nFinally, it's generally a sound notion that when you find a book accompanied by nothing but encomiastic reviews without a trace of reservation, that there's something's rotten in the state of Amazon.\n\nThree stars--It's still Banville, and nobody writes like him.  At his worst, he's still far above, in a different realm, compared to most anything my would-be library patron might find on those sparse shelves - Unless, of course, s/he chances upon Proust.", "Feedback": "moderate"}
{"ReviewerID": "A319KYEIAZ3SON", "ProductID": "B000XUBDUS", "Review": "Fascinating, challenging, rewarding. Axel Vander tells us from the opening of this sensitive and tension-filled study of identity that he is not who he says he is. A respected scholar and professor at a California college, Vander is recognized for his thoughtful philosophical papers and books, especially on the nature of identity. Just before he leaves for a conference on Nietzsche in Turin, however, he receives a letter from a young woman in Antwerp, questioning his own identity and asking to meet with him. As the novel unfolds, we come to know more about the \"real\" Axel Vander and more about his mysterious correspondent, the emotionally disturbed Cass Cleave.\n\nLike Banville's narrators in other novels, the elderly Axel Vander of Shroud is unreliable and often dishonest, self-concerned but not self-aware. Consummately venal, he blithely takes advantage of whatever circumstances arise. Cass Cleave, the daughter of Alexander Cleave, the narrator of Banville's previous novel, Eclipse, has visions and seizures, and Vander regards her as mad, but she and Vander develop a relationship of almost religious significance. He is depraved and amoral, and she is a sick, avenging angel.\n\nIn Turin, where she joins Axel, Cass sees religious symbolism in common events, finding an ordinary breakfast a form of communion. Artworks, especially crucifixion scenes by artists from the various settings in which the novel takes place (Cranach, Bosch, Memling, and Van Eyck in the Low Countries; and Tintoretto, Mantegna, and Bellini in Italy) further develop the symbolism. Always present in the background, of course, is the Shroud of Turin, which may be the real burial cloth of Jesus--or may not be. Parallels and contrasts between Vander and Jesus abound.\n\nBanville's novel is intense, highly compressed in its development of overlapping themes, and filled with suspense, both real and intellectual. Every plot detail expands his themes of identity and selfhood, and our desire to be remembered after our deaths. Banville's prose is exquisite, creating mystery by introducing details at a snail's pace, conveying attitude, and acutely observing sensuous details and physical reactions. He juxtaposes unlikely events from different times to convey information, providing voluptuous descriptions which contain both an idea and its antithesis simultaneously. This is a challenging and fascinating novel, beautifully crafted and rewarding on every level. Mary Whipple", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "AUEY946M1L939", "ProductID": "B000XUBDUS", "Review": "Note the tripytch-like structure around the protagonist Well, following other reviewers on Amazon who have proven the thoughtful equals of Banville's own intelligent fiction makes my own comments rather anti-climactic. I'm glad I hadn't read the summary or the comments before I opened Shroud--warning: major plot spoilers abound! Suffice it to say that David Lehman's \"Signs of the Times\" on the late 1980s Paul deMan revelations, while not receiving explicit credit in the author's notes, can shed light on the inspiration for Banville, much as the Blount spy episode does for The Untouchable, which pairs neatly with this novel as two portraits of unlikeable but captivating men that Banville sketches not with a righteous incrimination but a humanist compassion as he seems to report rather than construct their tales. No other comments have appeared on the triptych-like structure of the novel, so about this I will add a few words.\n\nThe first part, the left-hand side of Banville's objet d'art, presents a smug, self-satisfied roue. I was thrown off, I admit, by the cleverly planted aside about the \"Hebrew\" neighbor who watches the scholar as he leaves Arcady, California--itself conveyed sharply and concisely in its summery smells and languid allure. It reminded me of Thomas Mann in Pacific Palisades in exile from the Nazis. Cass, at her entrance, appears annoyingly at his side, as if to whisper calumnies in his ear; at his other side I imagine the older Kristina Kovacs recriminating him with upraised finger and brow before an academic crowd--the whole rarified and curiously solipsistic atmosphere of a lit-crit conference amusingly captured, again by Banville, in only a couple of pages (it took David Lodge, no slouch himself, many novels to do the same--which I also highly recommend!). The scene of the woman run over in the street, which may appear on the margin of this segment, disturbed me greatly; it can be seen only more clearly in retrospect as foreshadowing, I suppose. This section's characteristic passage shows Banville's prose at its customary best: \"Flakes of ash from his cigarette fell on her breast, tiny, warm, weightless kisses.\" (76)\n\nIn the central frame, the protagonist turns victim. Here, the Graham Greene-landish nature of Querell in The Untouchable seems to color the prose; \"I would like to be the protagonist of one of those third-rate, so-called philosophical novles that were so popular in the haunted postwar years, the man who takes on the identity of a sinner all unaware that the one he is impersonating was a saint all along.\" (150) While Banville avoids such a neat juxtaposition to his credit, this echo seems to issue from Greene's own fiction. This can best be seen in the miniature depictions: a mysterious train ride to and from Brussels, and the apparition of an ambiguous savior from the ruins of the protagonist's family home. The pace of this central action rouses itself from the torpor of the left-frame, part one.\n\nFor the right-hand section, the action fades and after what for me was the climactic revelation around page 150, the remaining section is prepared for by: \"The year and I are both declining; there is a chill in the air.\" (177) With part three, the last sixty pages present more of a diminishing presence of all of the main characters. This last section, however, in its deliberately blurred and less substantially rendered details, involved me less than it could have. Death in Turin rather than Venice, yes, but again this morbidity shrouds the last segment in shadows more than sun. I see here the momento mori, the aging and contorted figures, the skulls and the devils awaiting below the ledge. If the opening of the book recalls Beckett, the end summons up the aftermath of another revelation--Greta to Gabriel, from Joyce's \"The Dead.\" For the protagonist of Banville's study, he is doomed to live on in a world of increasing gloom, descending while still alive into the Hades of his own making, and of what he has been made into by the ghosts of the last century.

The main character, Axel Vander, is conceited, obnoxious, and goes out of his way to offend the readers. He identifies himself as a masterly liar who lies about almost everything, even when there is no need and even when the plain truth will be so much more effective in maintaining the pretence. I will not be surprised at his unreliable narration, shameless boasting and impudent lies as he spatters out the tale of his life.\nThe shocking secret is that Axel Vander is not the real Axel Vander but has ineluctably appropriated the identity of an actor. He has impudently maintained the deception for over half a century since the time of danger during World War II. He must have thought he had shaken off his far past and wiped out all vestige of his old identity until the letter of Cass Cleave confronts him with irrefutable proof of his imposture. Banville devotes almost the whole novel chronicling Axel Vander's life, his delirious reflections, his reminiscence of his wife, the disturbing details of his impregnable alibi - all the minute heart-pricking details that permits Cass Cleave to privy the impostor's secret. Banville has written a beautifully crafted thriller, with meticulous prose, that prepares readers for the dreadful moment - the meeting of Axel Vander and his nemesis from whom he is so overwrought to buy silence for fear of being exposed.\nThe prose is incredulously lyrical, rich, and refined - so much more compressed and yet detailed any prose in most contemporary fiction. Banville is one of the few living author who can maintain the flow of a novel with a taut sense while flourishing different themes as well as exploring and exposing, delineating the intricacies of human emotions. The book leaves us in awe of the marvelous silence with which human tolerate lies. Once again Banville has epitomized literary fiction with a twisting intrigue, which is unfortunately exiguous in the market now.\n2004 (12)  MY", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2V3P1XE33NYC3", "ProductID": "B000XUBDUS", "Review": "Meet Axel Vander Imagine my overwhelming surprise when I dug deep into John Banville's \"Shroud\" and discovered a book oozing with sumptuous prose stylings, beautifully shaped characters, sumptuous scenery, and a plot both wondrous and fulfilling. I really did not think there were writers who could sculpt a book like this anymore. Most modern \"literature\" consists of shallow characters, banal dialogue, and pedestrian plot lines. Not Banville, or at least not in this stupendous story about a retired university professor and literature critic named Axel Vander. \"Shroud\" blew away many of my dogmatic conceptions about what literature means in this era of waning attention spans and lazy readers. Perhaps it will do the same for you.\nIt is extremely difficult to like Axel Vander. He is a mean-spirited, misogynistic, malicious, petty jerk. Moreover, Vander would be the first to admit that he is a jerk. He simply doesn't care what other people think about him, at least not on the surface. And he lies, oh how he lies. He describes himself as a \"virtuoso of lies\" and admits he spent his entire career as an academic attacking others while building his own career on superficiality. He rarely read the things he attacked and read less of those things on which he built his reputation. Everyone in Vander's life suffered through his unbearable presence, especially his late wife Magda. Vander ignored Magda until a bout with Alzheimer's disease finally forced him to deal with her. Although Vander may be the biggest jerk in the history of literature, occasional phrases or thoughts he has hint at someone greater than the sum of his parts.\nWhen we meet Vander, he is in a great dilemma. He recently received a letter from a young woman in Europe who discovered a grim secret in Vander's past, a secret that threatens to expose him and bring disgrace to his vaunted career. Vander feels he must meet this danger head on, so he goes to Turin, Italy, home of the sacred Shroud of Turin, to meet Cass Cleave. Vander is determined to savage this young rube in his characteristic way until he realizes that he is falling in love with the young Irish girl. In a deeply affecting sequence of events, Vander falls ill and relates the story of how he came to be who he is to Cass. Banville concludes \"Shroud\" with one surprise after another, keeping the reader constantly on his or her toes right to the very end.\nThere isn't one character in \"Shroud\" who is not deeply flawed or suffering in some grand way. Vander is an old, embittered alcoholic with no one left in the world but his own snarling rage. Cass Cleave suffers from a severe form of mental illness that induces seizures, makes her hear voices, and brings on thoughts of suicide. Vander's colleague and former flame Kristina Kovacs is slowly and painfully dying. Amongst all of these bleak valleys, Banville does hold out redemption to Vander, but it is a redemption fraught with immense peril for himself and those around him.\nThe backgrounds and situations painted by Banville here are simply marvelous. The first part of the book contains many symbolic scenes that emphasize the alienation and separation between people and how difficult it can be to overcome these vast differences. The author settles down a bit in the second and third parts of the story while managing to keep the story moving at a fevered pace. I have never been to Europe, but I feel like I have after reading this book. Yes, Banville's descriptive powers are that good.\nThe prose here is phenomenal. When I think of this book now, I keep returning to Banville's descriptions of pigeons. At one point, a flight of these birds taking off makes a sound like \"derisive applause.\" Another bird flying through the air looks like (paraphrase here) \"a constantly shifting series of inkblots.\" Who writes like this anymore? Well, apparently Axel Vander in his scholarly works, where he spent much time bending over dictionaries and other writing guides in order to shape his articles and books. One suspects this is a thinly veiled reference to Banville huddling around an Oxford English Dictionary while writing \"Shroud.\" Oddly enough, this is the second book I have read in the past month or so that uses the word \"matutinal,\" meaning something related to, or occurring, in the morning. The other author who freely bandied this word about was Nathaniel Hawthorne. Now if you are familiar with Hawthorne's work, you know his prose is fabulous. Banville's prose is just as spectacular as Hawthorne and his fellow 19th century authors.\n\"Shroud\" is more than eye candy. It is an insightful gaze into the deepest recesses of what it means to be human. I must say I had a sinking feeling as I closed the book after finishing the final page, a feeling that told me I missed many of Banville's intricately crafted subplots. This thought was quickly followed by another: it doesn't matter if I missed some points of the story. What I got out of it was enough to justify a thousand times over the choice I made to read this gorgeous work of art.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Megellas' account is certainly a great alternative to the over saturated 101st Airborne memoirs.\n\nWith a brief intro in to his life before and during training he quickly moved to his insertion in to the 82nd PIR as a replacement officer.  So he wasn't there from the beginning, but he was certainly close enough.  He fought in the hills of Italy in what seem like guerilla type warfare.  Although he experienced combat it wasn't until Anzio that he was baptized by fire and blooded his first German.  From this brutal battle he was sent back to England to rest and recuperate and ultimately missed D-Day.  His next major action was Operation Market Garden where he had to fight across the Waal River, which, from his description, was one of the more bloody engagements, and not well planned, of not only Operation Market Garden but also of WWII.  And yet he survived when the majority of the men around him were dying.  Battle of the Bulge came next where he battled German SS soldiers and single handedly, with H company, took out a tank and invaded and captured a town before the Germans could regroup.  Megellas certainly fought a lot and became an efficient killing machine.\n\nMy only criticism, and this very lightly, is that his account reads a lot like Band of Brothers.  A lot of the same stuff happened, in almost the same order, with enough frequency that you couldn't help wondering if he mimicked how Ambrose wrote in order to come up with a structure for his memoir.  Granted, a lot of what the paratroopers went though was the same, which is why this was only a light criticism.  The story could also become a little disjointed at times because he constantly interjected other people's quotes that were in their company or Rivers' company, using their input to support his thoughts or to give a first hand account of what happened when Megellas wasn't there.  On the one hand this detracted from his story when he was actually there, but on the other it helped portray a well rounded picture of not only what the men thought of him or the battles they were fighting, but gave a more detailed account of the 82nd as a whole.\n\nI would certainly recommend this to WWII buffs or for someone looking for some insight into the life of a combat officer in WWII, not too mention a paratrooper to boot.

In this book, author James Megellas (a/k/a \"Maggie\") tells us the story of intense and almost continuous combat beginning in North Africa, continuing in Italy, and finally D-Day and the invasion of Western Europe.  The author explains that his \"MOS\" (Military Occupational Specialty) was simply to \"Kill Germans\" and that this was the real, if unofficial, job description of himself and his men.  The author makes no bones about the merciless nature of the war.  Prisoners were sometimes shot by both sides, and to say that there were hard feelings is an understatement.  This was a rough war against a competent enemy who inflicted terrible casualties on allied soldiers, who in turn gave even better than they got.\n\nMagellas' observations and opinions about rear-echelon soldiers, and the psychology of the higher-ups who did little or no actual fighting, ring true.  He notes that it was the captains and lieutenants who really functioned as \"leaders\" of combat troops, and it was pretty obvious that Magellas was less than impressed with much of the upper brass.  The British brass comes in for particularly harsh criticism in the context of the failure of Montgomery's Operation Market-Garden.  Magellas also relates an astonishing incident in which British armor refused to advance to relieve besieged units of British paratroopers, which shirking allowed the Germans to massacre them.  The author takes the trouble to say that he \"personally witnessed this incident....\"\n\nBooks like this remind us in this time of relative peace (notwithstanding the very real fighting that goes on in the present day)  the tremendous debt that all of us owe to those who endured unspeakable danger and hardships to bring down Nazi Germany.

Book four of this famous series of YA Fantasy books is a solid and highly entertaining adventure yarn for the young and old book lover alike.  Book three ended with the escape and apparent liberation of Will and Evanlyn from a life of drugs and slavery, respectively, and it is not long into this fine adventure story (book four) when they are finally blessed with some much needed personal success by reacquainting themselves with old friends.  And a highly emotional scene that is guaranteed to be for all concerned.\n\nBut the story does end there, not by a long shot.  It turns out that those highly trained, highly skilled and highly ambitious Skandians from the northern region of the land have set their eyes on world domination, and it is not long before Halt can see the wood for the trees and rushes to convince everyone around him who will listen, that even the sweet, innocent, little land of Araluen is in danger of a foreign and very physical takeover.\n\nAnd so plans are made, and metaphorical lines have been drawn in the metaphorical sand.  Everyone has their thinking caps on, and that includes Halt (of course) and Will, Horace, and even the Princess in disguise when she is given the opportunity.  New friendships are forged between parties that have been enemies for generations that will have long lasting reverberations both in the books universe and the one we happen to find ourselves in.\n\nThe story is structured beautifully.  Chapters of action, and heroics and high emotion are followed by less stressful moments and yet are equally enjoyable, but of course, these are followed by the more action packed chapters again.  And the quiet moments are littered with text that turn out to possess significant pieces of information.  And don't even get me started on the cliffhangers that are spread throughout the story like grains of salt scattered over a gloriously prepared hot roast lunch.  Chapter one is a prime example.  It ends in a cliff hanger of immensely enjoyable proportions, and yet the story goes on its own merry way in chapter two with a nearly hysterical sequence of scenes featuring Halt and Horace as they suffer from a prime set of miscommunications.\n\nThe writing is not exactly world shatteringly beautiful.  How can it be when Rangers Apprentice is written primarily for younger folk.  But there are some fine words and phrases that can be taken to heart, such as the text that can be located at KL 1494.  I won't quote it here, as something that is meaningful to me may not resonate so strongly with a fellow bookworm.\n\nAnd so this book gets four stars.  I am just passed the half way mark, and if the ending is as good as I expect - this _is_ John Flanagan here, folks - I will let you know.\n\nBFN Greggorio!", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A26GI0KK03LSRR", "ProductID": "B000Y2I7OK", "Review": "YOUR EYES WILL BE FROZEN TO YOUR KINDLE SCREEN!!!!!!! The third volume of this immensely popular fantasy series for the younger (and, umm, slightly older) reader is as much fun, as much action, as much excitement and drama as the preceding two volumes combined.  Given the epic, brilliant, overwhelming cliff hanger type nature of the ending to book two, however, ICEBOUND LAND opens up in a way that, it must be said, is relatively timid.  Sure, Halt and Co are all worried sick about the plight and welfare of Will and young Evanlyn as they are hijacked by some of the storys baddies, and led (presumably) into a life of depraved, mind bending and back breaking slavery, but the two young characters in question are not showing all that much physical or emotional hardship over the matter.  At least, not yet, anyway.\n\nAt least Ranger Halt is desperate (and brave) enough to use the laws of his Kingdom to force it to his will as he seeks a way to go after his young ward and apprentice and bring him (and his partner) back home to safety.\n\nThere has been no further sign of evil in the side of the destroyed Morgarath - but that does not mean another young usurper to his crown won't stand up and take control of all things twisted and evil in their own doomed attempt to run the world.  Nor has there been any more major (bad) characters for the reader to dislike intensely.  Margaroth was brilliantly drawn and represented in the first two books, and in some respects it is a shame that he was killed off so early.  He was evil, but at least he was fun to read about, and fun to hate.\n\nNaturally readers everywhere hope to see the day that Will and Evanlyn find their freedom and return to loved ones back home.  That may well happen by the end of this book - but even if it does, the eternal battle against the forces of evil goes on, and on, and on.  And that is a good thing, it must be said.  Mr Flanagan bas crafted a fantasy tale so deep, so enriching, so fulfilling and so much fun to immerse yourself in, that you simply don't want it to stop.\n\nAnother flaw I can think of is the lack of magic in the story.  No wizards, no witches, no warlocks have dared to show their face on centre stage of this compelling set of adventures.\n\nBut that is not to say they wont.  I for one hope that it is not too long before magic becomes a character in the story in its own right.  But until it does, sharing the journey with the fine, impeccable, innocent, true, honest characters that John Flanagan has gifted the world with so far, will do me just fine.\n\nFour stars for this beauty.\n\nBFN Greggorio!", "Feedback": "positive"}

Though still weakened by the warmweed's toxic effects, Will employs his Ranger training to locate his friend, but an enemy scouting party has him fatally outnumbered. Will is certain death is close at hand, until Halt and Horace make a daring, last-minute rescue. The reunion is cut short, however, when Halt makes a horrifying discovery: Skandia's borders have been breached by the entire Temujai army. And Araluen is next in their sights. If two kingdoms are to be saved, an unlikely union must be made. Will it hold long enough to vanquish a ruthless new enemy? Or will past tensions spell doom for all?\n\nThe Good: As stated in earlier reviews, the first two books in the series were very much a stereotypical good vs. evil, sword and sorcery fantasy, but as the series progressed, it becomes much more complicated and deeper story.\n\nAs usual, the world building is absolutely superb. The authors description of combat doctrines and tactics over a prolonged campaign, are almost right on the money for realism and are more likely than not, based off of real tactics from a past age.\n\nThe Temujai are clearly based on the barbarian hordes of Central Asia such as the Mongols and the Huns. What can also be learned from them is how the Roman Empire and to some extent modern militaries, worked so well, On his own, a Roman Legionnaire was nothing special in the way of single combat, but when a part of a large, cohesive unit, they were almost unstoppable. A disciplined, ordered force will almost always prevail against a chaotic force even if severely outnumbered. There is something to be learned in that even beyond combat.\n\nA common trope in fantasy and science fiction is one person or a small platoon defeating an entire army of hopelessly incompetent grunts. That doesnt happen in this book and the Skandians are forced to utilize guerrilla tactics in order to prevail against the tactically superior Temujai.\n\nThat does not mean the acclaimed characters of this series are left out by any means. The Arulaen quartet meant to leave Skandia forever but now they realize their country is in danger from the Temujai if they succeed in conquering Skandia. The two nations have long been enemies but the old adage: enemy of my enemy comes into play and it is interesting to see bitter foes set aside their differences for the common good.\n\nWill is still weak from his ordeal from the warmweed and he does not recover right away. Again, playing to the realism. All the characters go through growth when they are so far from home and forced into challenging circumstances. Halt has to come into his own as a strategist after working on his own or among fellow rangers for so long. Horaces skills are put to the test and Evanlyn struggles with her role as a princess out of her kingdom. Finally the Skandians and Erak have to face an enemy that won't flee at the sight of their wolfships. Everyone is put to the test.\n\nNo spoilers but going along with the authors theme of breaking cliches, the expected romantic angle near the end does not play out and the book as well as the series is much better off for it.\n\nThe Flaws: The major flaw in this book is that maybe it focuses too much on the war. What makes this series so stellar is the personal relationships between the characters, which are pushed to the side a great deal in this story. There is still a lot of talking, but it is almost completely related to the major conflict. Even at the beginning with the heartfelt reunion, the next passage moves on to the Temujai. This is not a deal-breaker but for readers who are looking for a deeper exploration into the ties that bind Horace, Evanlyn, Will, and Halt, they will be disappointed.\n\nAlso, as one could expect from a medieval fantasy, this book is a bit on the violent side, considering that its about a war. Its never particularly gory but it does describe people fighting and dying. Its good that the author never shies away from the realities of warfare but since this is a book aimed at younger readers, this fact could raise some concerned eyebrows.\n\nFinal Verdict: A fascinating look into medieval warfare in a fantastic setting with equally fantastic characters.\n\nFour out Five Stars\n\nthecultureworm.blogspot.com", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A1UIPIUXWFY9CZ", "ProductID": "B000Y2I7OK", "Review": "Bookworm Speaks!- The Icebound Land by John Flanagan Bookworm Speaks!\n\nThe Icebound Land: Rangers Apprentice Book 3\n\nBy John Flanagan\n\n****\n\nThe Story: Kidnapped after the fierce battle with Lord Morgarath, Will and Evanlyn are bound for Skandia as captives aboard a fearsome wolfship. Halt has sworn to rescue Will, and he will do anything to keep his promiseeven defy his King. Expelled from the Rangers he has served so loyally, Halt is joined by Will's friend Horace as he travels toward Skandia. On their way, they are challenged constantly by freelance knightsbut Horace knows a thing or two about combat. Soon he begins to attract the attention of knights and warlords for miles around with his uncanny skill. Even so, will they be in time to rescue Will from a horrific life of slavery?\n\nThe Good: This will be said a lot as Bookworm reviews this series but it is no less true. The characters are what pulls this book through beginning to end. The best way to thoroughly explore a character is to take them out of their element and introduce new challenges to be thrown in their way. The author does this with all of the major characters to great effect.\n\nWill and Evanlyn/Cassandra are definitely out of their element in the frigid land of Skandia. Skandia is so different from Arulaen that it literally sucks the life of them, especially Will. Evanlyn is a princess and while inured to hardship, as evinced by events in the second book, becoming a slave to a Jarl is definitely outside her comfort zone. The fact that Will becomes little more than an invalid, she is forced to rely on her own wits and not those of others if she is to prevail.\n\nThe story of Horace and Halt is an exciting story arc all on its own. Once again, the author doesnt do all that much with them, he simply lets the two disparate personalities bounce off one another. Horace and Halt are such differing characters, Halts withdrawn, dry wit contrasted with Horaces easygoing, outgoing personality, that seeing them together is very entertaining. The way that they learn from each other is extremely authentic in their interactions and since these characters are so different we see other aspects of their personalities.\n\nOnce again we see the extent of the authors skill at world building. It is quite obvious that the Skandians are meant to be analogues of the Vikings and Vikings were legendary warriors and pillagers and while we see plenty of evidence about that we also delve deeper into the culture of the Skandians (Vikings) and see their way of life. This even extends to Horaces and Halts journey through Gallica. The way knights are portrayed are closer to their historical parallels than what modern culture has portrayed them as over the years. Many of the them were little more than enforcers for their local lords or themselves that a gallant hero.  It is to the authors credit that he builds the Skandian culture to such an extent, giving them an angle of realism. It would be all too easy to craft the Skandians as the villain race and nothing more, such as the Orcs from Lord of the Rings. To give them multiple angles greatly aids in the crafting of the world, these characters live in.\n\nThe Flaws: While the stories are fun this book could very well be considered a filler by most standards of fantasy series. The plot does not really advance in that there is still no resolution to the crisis that had started with The Burning Bridge. Its more of a setup for the fourth volume in the series. The character development is really what pulls the book through but the story is lacking somewhat.\n\nThe author may once or twice delve into the stereotypes of Viking culture. The most notable of which is the fact that Vikings did not wear horned helmets. Its not that big a deal, considering its a fantasy, but it is one of those little things that can nag at the reader.\n\nThe most controversial aspect of this tome is how Will becomes addicted to a drug called Warmweed, that the Skandians use to keep their slaves in line. It turns Will into a shuffling, mindless, drone. Leaving Evanlyn to care for him. Some may argue that portraying drug addiction, fictional it may be, is a detriment to the narrative as it sissifies the main character of Will. Also, the fact of dealing with drugs in a series intended for young readers could turn off many readers.\n\nThe tasks that Will must perform are difficult and arduous, both mentally and physically, and the weed that Will is given genuinely seems to help him get through it all. That is what makes drug addiction so insidious. No one chooses to become addicted, they feel like they genuinely need it in order to get through their lives and before they know it, they cant live without it. This is never expressly stated but it is there and some readers may be shocked at such a portrayal.\n\nTo be honest: This a good way to teach kids about drug addiction.\n\nFinal Verdict: While this may fall under the category of bridge novel, The Icebound Land is a worthy continuation of the previous arc and takes the reader through new lands and new adventures.\n\nFour out of Five Stars.\n\nthecultureworm.blogspot.com", "Feedback": "positive"}

{"ReviewerID": "A2Z8VKSQDWHSGE", "ProductID": "B000Y2I7OK", "Review": "The Battle for Skandia Is a Retreat for the Series \"The Battle for Skandia\" is the fourth book in John Flanagan's Ranger Apprentice series.  Picking up where book three had dramatically ended (not strictly a cliffhanger but definitely a \"you now have to read the next book\" ending), \"The Battle for Skandia\" sees Will, Halt, and their friends join forces with their erstwhile Skandian enemies to fight off an invading force of Temujai from the eastern steppes.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed book three, \"The Battle for Skandia\" fell flat quickly and never completely recovered.  The third book ended with Will and Evanlyn in hiding, on the run from the Skandians, with Will's mentor Halt and friend Horace seemingly nowhere close to finding them.  Will himself has to fight off the lingering effects of a warmweed addiction.  How will they survive?  How will they find each other?  Miraculously, they just all happen to converge on the same Temujai camp and are happily reunited within the first 65 pages.  Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this was not just a suspension, but an expulsion.  The drama and tension that elevated book three were frittered away.  Beyond that, Will's and Evanlyn's ready willingness to defend the same people who had captured, enslaved, and brutalized them was also unconvincing.\n\nAllowances, of course, must be made for the fact that the target audience are middle-school children and not adults approaching (ahem) middle age.  My daughter, though, who is in the target demographic had a similar reaction to mine.  That being said, Flanagan's style is always pleasant and readable and there are much worse ways to spend an afternoon than hanging out with Will and the others.  Parents should be mindful that there is a lot of battle violence here, and while not George R.R. Martin graphic it is still more than cartoon violence and may bother some young readers.", "Feedback": "moderate"}

Often, the best fiction stories are those that transport us to distant lands and take us away from our mundane lives.  The Icebound Land accomplishes that goal nicely.  The narrative follows two stories.  In one, Will and Evanlyn deal with their new lives as captives of a Viking-type society.  In the other, Halt and Horace travel through a Malory-inspired land replete with knights issuing challenges at bridges.  The prose is straightforward enough to be read by young readers (my daughter devoured the series while in fourth grade) yet is by no means too juvenile for more mature readers.\n\nAlthough this is the third book in the series, it can be read and enjoyed without reading the prior volumes.  The thrill is less in the plot than in Flanagan's ability to draw the reader into his worlds.  I recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed tales of King Arthur and wants to recapture that magic.", "Feedback": "positive"}

At the time of my review I see 67 5-Star or 4-Star reviews.  Nothing below that.  I can believe it.  I just finished reading the 4th book in this series and I was very impressed.  Somehow John writes a story for young adults but does not sugar-coat it, and makes it very readable for adults like me (over 50+ yrs).  The characters are well developed and the author makes sure each character has his or her fair share of \"prime time\".  By not sugar-coating the story, I mean this story features many fighting scenes, and a well detailed battle.  People fight and die on both sides of the battle.  Remember the A-Team TV show?  Bullets zipping all over the place, explosions, and cars crashing and flipping over and yet, no one ever died!  Not even hurt too bad.  Talk about watered down violence!  John manages to walk a fine line here, he does not write the battle scenes too easy or too gory.

Having Halt in the book for the majority of the story was great, he is my favorite character of the bunch.\n\nThe plot was again fairly predictable and a bit contrived.

After months as prisoners and then slaves of the Skandians, Will and Evanlyn (in reality, Princess Cassandra of Araluen in disguise) have escaped - with a little help from Erak, the senior Jarl who first captured them. The imprisonment has not been kind to Will. As a yard slave, the apprentice Ranger was made an addict of the toxic and mind-numbing warmweed and it has taken most of the winter to drive the drug from his system. Now Will, though horribly weakened, is back in his right mind and his return has come not a moment too soon. The spring thaw has finally arrived in the frozen north and Will and Evanlyn must resume their difficult journey toward Araluen and freedom.\n\nFor Evanlyn, freedom proves regrettably short-lived. Captured by a Temujai scout, she's once again a prisoner - having never left Skandia at all. Although he is pitifully weak and without weapons, Will manages to track Evanlyn and the Tem'uj who holds her. They are in a temporary Temujai camp with a half dozen more Tem'uj and Evanlyn is about to be executed. Outnumbered and armed with only a toy-like hunting bow, Will is prepared to make his last stand defending the princess when help arrives from a most welcome and unexpected quarter.\n\nReunited, Halt, Horace, Will and Evanlyn are preparing to slip across the Skandian border and resume their homeward journey when they make a terrifying discovery. An entire Temujai army is camped in the wilds of Skandia in preparation for a killing assault on the capital at Hallasholm. More to the point, they are blocking the Araluen party's escape route. Furthermore, Halt knows that if the Temujai are successful in their invasion of Skandia, they will gain the ships they need to spread war to the rest of the Western world - including Araluen. In order to protect the homeland they love Halt, Will, Horace and Evanlyn are going to have to join with their former enemies to defend Hallasholm and the rest of this wild, frozen nation.\n\nVery few authors can sustain excellence over a long series of books. Even with trilogies it is common to find one volume that is weaker than the rest. That is a part of what makes The Ranger's Apprentice series so amazing. The Battle for Skandia is the fourth Ranger's Apprentice novel and, like the trio that precede it, this is a marvelous read. The story is fast-paced and exciting and the action is described in evocative language that places the reader squarely in the world Mr. Flanagan has created. Unlike the characters in many other series, those in The Ranger's Apprentice continue to change and grow with each volume. I'd say this was my favorite book in the series, but honestly, it's very hard to choose one over the others. They are all that good.", "Feedback": "positive"}

As with the first two novels in this stellar series, The Icebound Land delivers a gripping story filled with interesting characters and places, and with just enough plot turns to keep you guessing until the end.\n\nIn the chaos that followed the fearsome final battle with Lord Morgarath, young apprentice Ranger Will and his new friend Evanlyn are taken captive by the fierce Skandian raider, Jarl Erak. Disgusted by the failure in Araluen, Erak plans to sell Will and Evanlyn as slaves to covers the expenses for his journey across the Stormwhite Sea. Will and Evanlyn fight to stay together as they make the wild sea voyage, but once they reach the Skandian capital of Hallasholm, an insidious enemy threatens to take Will away for good. Only Evanlyn's ingenuity and courage - and the aid of an unlikely ally - can save them both.\n\nBack in Araluen, Halt is increasingly frustrated by King Duncan's refusal to allow him to pursue the Skandians and rescue Will. He made a promise to recover his apprentice and he means to keep that promise, even if doing so means defying his King and forsaking his vow as a Ranger. Shamed, stripped of his place in the Ranger Corps and banished from the Kingdom of Araluen, Halt sets out to rescue Will, but he is not alone. Will's best friend and former wardmate, Horace is an apprentice warrior with a natural gift for swordplay. He joins Halt on the journey and stands beside him as they cross the treacherous Gallican countryside.\n\nThis series continues to captivate. Mr. Flanagan has a real knack for describing the strategy and actuality of skirmishes and battles, as well as for building an interesting and detailed world.

Not so.  Thankfully, I'm behind in the series so I have the next one to hand.  Unfortunately I'm listening to them with my family in the car on audiobook and it's gonna be a while before we settle in for another long drive to get to the next one.\n\nAs we last left our heroes, Will had been kidnapped by the Skandians (Vikings) and Halt had been forced to watch his protg's abduction helplessly.  Well, things are changing.  Halt is a Ranger, a man of action and one who views the word IMPOSSIBLE with disdain.  Since Halt is forsworn to stay to protect the King of Araluen (England), he has to sit and chafe while wondering about Will.\n\nThe thing I love about Halt is that he will find ways to get things done without breaking his code of honor.  That makes him the best of friends and yet the most implacable of enemies.  He will let nothing stand in his way - not even duty or a friend.  I felt badly for him when he had to stand before the King, his friend, and be judged for his actions, but at the same time I was proud of him.  That's the true sign of a writer bringing a character to life.  In my mind, Halt lives.\n\nThe thing that really captured my imagination and my heart was the way Horace accompanies Halt on his mission to get Will back.  All the political connections and friendships really come to bear in this novel, and it just shows how deep and rich Flanagan has developed his story world.\n\nOf course, the author is pretty much bending the Middle Ages the way he wants them bent to serve his story, but I'm really okay with that.  Flanagan knows how to unreel a rollicking good tale.  My family and I are carried to distant lands every time the CD spins through the player and we drive down the road.\n\nThis book quickly evolves into two complete stories.  Will and Evanlyn's tale in Skandia is bleak and hard as they're put into slavery after a harsh voyage.  I like Erak's development in this story, and I know he's going to develop into a major player in this series.  Seems like everywhere Will and Halt go they're forging new bonds, taking on new responsibilities.  But that's just fun!\n\nHorace and Halt's trip through Gallica (France) is an absolute blast.  I love how these two characters play off each other, how Halt's conniving flies in the face of Horace's need for honor and fair play.  The bit about the challenges of the various knights and the pack train of goods Horace accumulates as the results of his battles is magnificent.\n\nThe end battle between Halt and Deparnieux was extremely well done and shows what a calculating and cunning warrior the Ranger is.  How can you not love this guy?\n\nWill kind of fades away at the end of this novel, though, and I missed him sorely.  Still, Erak steps up and helps Evanlyn see to their safety.  Her struggle to break Will's addiction to Warm-Weed was well done and filled with emotion.\n\nI'm anxiously awaiting the opportunity to get onto the fourth book.

First, they need to survive the trip. Once they arrive, they will have to face their fate as overworked slaves. In the mean time, Halt, who shows more of an emotional side, goes off the deep end since the loss of his apprentice and ends up being banished. Taking advantage of no longer having his ranger duties, he sets out after Will and is accompanied by Horace (who received secret permission to join him).\n\nThe continued character development is great. Again, you see more of a human side of Halt as he himself realizes just how much Will meant to him. It is amazing how far Horace has come, from the brat he was at the beginning of the first book to the highly mature, loyal, and dedicated Knight's apprentice.

They will be kept as hostages or sold into slavery. Together they endure storms at sea, the toil of captivity and the dark Skandian winter in the hope that they will live to see their Araluen home again.\n\nMeanwhile, Will's friends Halt and Horace are on a quest to rescue Will. They make a name for themselves defeating knights throughout Gallica, until they are captured by a cruel and petty warlord who keeps them prisoner in his tower.\n\nIn dealing with the aftermath of the battle with Lord Morgorath, this third installment in the Ranger's Apprentice series takes a detour from fantasy's classic conflict of good versus evil. Having defeated the supernatural threat to their country, the characters are now confronted with difficult moral choices and human dilemmas. A darker book than its predecessors, THE ICEBOUND LAND deals with slavery, addiction and the problem of violence in a world where might makes right.\n\nEach of the characters is strained to his or her limit. Halt commits treason against his beloved country in order to search for his apprentice. Horace questions the codes of chivalry when he encounters those using them for selfish ends. Evanlyn bears the burden of Will's survival in harsh conditions she was not raised to endure.\n\nThese difficult conditions and moral quandaries make for more interesting conflicts and characters. Even some of the villains come to question their roles. Erak, a Scandian raider, admires the determination and bravery of his captives. He sees Will and Evanlyn as better examples of the Skandian warrior code than many of his countrymen. His choices completely change the direction of the narrative but cannot repeal the unbreakable Vallasvow his oberjarl has sworn against the Araluen royal family.\n\nLike the previous books in the series, THE ICEBOUND LAND ends with a cliffhanger. Having already defeated the dark lord and endured captivity, the series has also become more intriguing. Who knows what adventures will befall Will and his friends next? Will they continue to battle the human evils that run rampant in their world? Or will the disparate parties be called to unite against the threat of a greater supernatural evil once again?\n\nRanger's Apprentice takes place in an imaginary world, but it echoes certain geographical and historical realities of this one. The Skandians are clearly based on the Norse raiders who terrorized the coast of Britain around 800. Celtica's mining culture is reminiscent of Wales, while Gallica takes both its name and its approximate language from medieval France in the age of chivalry circa 1300. Araluen is England, standing --- as it has since Tolkien --- at the heart of fantasy literature.\n\nWhile Ranger's Apprentice borrows from already-established fantasy tropes, it has been marvelously popular with young readers of fantasy. John Flanagan's elevation of a ranger character, someone more gifted at stealth and marksmanship than brute force, has fleshed out an often-neglected portion of fantasy literature. His reliance on themes of loyalty, bravery, endurance and friendship leave young readers in safe hands as they learn to navigate dangerous waters on their own.", "Feedback": "positive"}

And what makes the difference here (at least to me) is the fact that the reader gets a nice feeling, a warm glow, when our heroes finally deliver the comeuppance to the bad guys.\n\n3.)The story has now diversified enough to various geographic locales that a map would have been nice to help follow the travels of our heroes.\n\nConclusion:\nYoung Adult writing that will hold the interest and be entertaining enough for most adult fantasy/adventure lovers. A map would be bonus, nonetheless I'm looking forward to book IV.  4 1/2 to 5 Stars.\n\nRay Nicholson", "Feedback": "positive"}

In the previous volume, Will and Evanlyn escape from Ragnak's hall and flee into the mountains.  They stay in a small cabin awaiting winter's end.  Halt and Horace leave Montsombre and head toward the reopened passes to Skandia.\n\nIn this novel, Will is an apprentice Ranger from Araluen.  He is just now  recovering from his addiction to warmweed in a cabin within the foothills.  The weather is thawing and they can soon leave Skandia.\n\nEvanlyn Wheeler is an Araluen woman who is using a false name.  She is really the Princess Cassandra, the daughter of King Duncan of Araluen. She is glad that Will is throwing off his addiction, but cautions him to take it easy for a while.\n\nHalt is a full Ranger, dangerous and feared.  He is searching for Will and Evanlyn.  He has been accompanied by Horace and is slowly becoming used to his incessant questions.\n\nHorace is Will's friend and a knight trainee.  He is very good with sword and lance, seeming to be a natural armsman.  But he is not very accomplished in politics and intrigue.\n\nErak Starfollower is a Skandian Jarl and captain of the raider ship Wolfwind.  He has brought Will and Evanlyn back to Skandia and gave them to Overjarl Ragnak as slaves.  Later, Erak helped Will and Evanlyn to escape.\n\nIn this story, Evanlyn goes out to check the snares while Will stays behind to rest.  A Temujai scout captures her and takes her back to his camp.  Will wakes and realizes that Evanlyn has been gone far too long.\n\nWill writes a message to tell her to stay at the cabin if she returns and then leaves to follow her trail.  He takes much longer reach the first snare than Evanlyn did, having to rest fairly often.  When he finally arrives, he reads the signs and starts following the trail.  After a long and exhausting walk, he reaches the Temujai camp.\n\nAfter checking out the security and noticing Evanlyn, Will decides to go take a nap.  He is not going to be able to rescue her while he is so tired.  And he only has a hunting bow and a small knife as weapons against six armed Temujai warriors.\n\nThe next day, the Temujai leader decides to dispose of Evanlyn.  As he strides over to the girl while drawing his sword, Will steps out into plain view and shoots him in the wrist.  Then the other warriors run toward him with weapons in hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Halt and Horace have reached the border of Skandia and find the border guards dead from Temujai arrows.  They follow the smaller band that enters Skandia and comes upon the camp just as Will is shooting the leader.\n\nHalt quickly shoots some of the Temujai and Horace captures the one who attempts to kill Evanlyn.  Two others escape.  Then the Araluen and their captive quickly ride away from the campsite.\n\nThis tale brings the Araluens together with Erak on the trail.  The Skandians had been tracking the Temujai and ambushes the Araluens.  Then Halt explains the coming invasion.  Erak declares a truce and goes with Halt to scout the invader.\n\nNeedless to say, Erak makes a very bad scout.  He sounds like a bear walking through the woods.  And his horsemanship is poor at best.\n\nThis novel confronts the Skandians with an overwhelming invasion by the Temujai.  Halt decides to help them stop the invaders.

In the previous volume, Will and Evanlyn burned the bridge over the Fissure, but were captured by Skandians.  The Araluen forces broke Morgarath's army and then Horace challenged Morgarath himself.\n\nIn this novel, Will is a Ranger apprentice.  He is small and quick and deadly with his bow and knives.\n\nEvanlyn Wheeler is an Araluen woman, but she has used a false name to protect her father from extortion.  She is really Princess Cassandra, the daughter of King Duncan of Araluen.\n\nHalt is a full Ranger, dangerous and feared.  He has become used to Will and his incessant questions.\n\nHorace is Will's friend and a knight trainee.  He is very good with sword and lance, seeming to be a natural armsman.\n\nErak is a Skandian Jarl and captain of the raider ship Wolfwind.  He and his crew have escaped from the battle of the Plains and are heading home.  He is also taking Will and Evanlyn with him to be sold as slaves.\n\nIn this story, the Wolfwind is caught by a storm before reaching Cape Shelter and is blown south.  Will has never been on a ship before and the huge waves are very scary.  He and Evanlyn are tied to the mast to keep them from being washed overboard, but Will has never known such fear as when the waves break over the ship and flood the deck.\n\nThe Wolfwind finally sails beyond Cape Shelter and beaches on Skorghijl Island.  With the storm season upon them, it would be too dangerous to try to reach Skandia.  So the Wolfwind crew will wait out the season on the island.\n\nThe crew settles into the crude barracks and messhall.  Naturally, all the menial chores are done by Will and Evanlyn.  Then another wolfship arrives, without a mast and riding low in the water.\n\nWolf Fang is owned by Slagor, a Skandian Skirl -- ship captain -- who had decided to sail south during a lull in the storms.  He had hoped to take the best prizes while the other wolfships were awaiting the end of the season, but this was obviously an unwise decision.  Slagor is not a very good captain, for he is foolish and a coward.  His crew are petty criminals, who have joined him only for the wages and loot.\n\nMeanwhile, Halt tries to gain permission to rescue Will and Evanlyn, but his requests are denied by Crowley -- leader of the Rangers -- and King Duncan is avoiding him.  So Halt gets himself banished from Araluen for a year.  Gilan tries to accompany him into exile, but Halt convinces him that one of them should stay behind to hunt for Foldar, Morgarath's escaped lieutenant.\n\nHowever, Halt finds himself unable to refuse Horace.  The two travel across the Narrow Sea to Gallia and proceed north toward Skandia.  They are constantly delayed by Gallian knights demanding tolls to cross minor bridges, but Horace clears the way.\n\nFinally, Halt paints a green oak leave on Horace's shield so that the Gallians will know his identity.  Most knights encountered afterward fled rather than facing the feared Knight of the Order of the Oak Leaf.  Horace does complain about using the unearned title of knight, but Halt overcomes his qualms.\n\nThen they reach a small town and take rooms in an inn.  Horace and Halt have real beds to sleep on.  But then Deparnieux -- the local warlord -- arrives to challenge Horace to a duel.\n\nThis tale takes Will and Evanlyn to the small town of Hallasholm.  Erak gives them to Oberjarl Ragnak and they are separated, with Evanlyn assigned to the kitchen and Will working in the yard.  Halt and Horace are delayed by snow in the passes to Skandia.\n\nThis story continues with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Battle-for-Skandia/dp/0142413402/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Battle for Skandia</a>.

One note before I start this review...\nHave you noticed that the covers for the Ranger's Apprentice series has changed? I have been collecting the series in USA paperback editions with the covers not containing the metal-shield-banner (by Cliff Nielsen), with the artwork of John Blackford not enlarged. These new covers are now demanding more attention, when they are already getting enough from widespread fans around the world and I must say that I'm not very fond of them. Nevertheless, on with the review...\n\nRanger's Apprentice: The Battle for Skandia (or also known as The Oakleaf Bearer's) is about the continuations of Halt/Horace hunting down and rescuing Will and Evalyn. It also continues the plot of the Skandians and the beloved (although not very hug-a-ble) Erik. But when they are all finally reunited, Halt reports that he shall a small group of Temujai (a dangerous race of mounted warriors, reminding us vividly of Genghis Khan's and his Mongolian army) invading the lands of Skandia.\nHalt convinces Erik that they need to think up a plan besides rushing at the enemy head-on, and Halt becomes the key figure to Skandias' only hope. But while the Skandians prepare to face a great enemy, other forces, within and without, are working against them.\nI' am very relieved that John Flanagan has provided us with a re-boost of electricity since the last installment of his, The Icebound Land, was a bit dull of action. This book could had easily ended the series on a happy note... oh, I wasn't suppose to tell you that. But, anyway, be prepared for a lot of hardcore action (although not graphical, since this series is for young adults/kiddies), a bit of fowl language and on-the-edge-of-your-seat-drama!

{"ReviewerID": "A3DWENW34NQEAV", "ProductID": "B000Y2I7OK", "Review": "Exciting, Entertaining, Engaging...Best in Series So Far ***minor spoilers ahead***\nI would rate this book a 4.75 (of 5), the deduction coming from a few technical issues I have with the author's choice of paragraph breaks and a few instances of lame dialogue.  Listening to the story on a cd would answer for the first point quite nicely.  The second point is a matter of personal preference, and some people may actually like the whole \"what\" scene that thoroughly annoyed me.  It reminded me of Abbott and Costello's \"Who's on First\" skit.  One time around, its funny, but more than once struck a painful chord within me.\n\nAside from that though, the story flowed rather nicely.  In a few instances the sequence of events was far too convenient to be anything but a children's fantasy story, but it still fit nicely enough to engage the reader.  Split second rescues, daring battles, and nicely executed battle tactics still make for a lovely story.\n\nCharacterization seemed better than the previous three books, but I think that's only because the previous three books could set it up.  If you just picked up this book and read, you'd get a neat little story, but you wouldn't have the emotional connection to the characters.  Some series are fine out of order (i.e. Star Wars: X-Wing series), but this is definitely a series to read in the intended order.\n\nAs for the title change from Oakleaf Bearers (Australia) to Battle for Skandia (U.S.), I'd have to say the US title strikes closer to the heartbeat of the story.  The Australian title is better seen in scope of the whole series, and probably would have made better sense on book 3...but as mentioned elsewhere, book 3 and 4 could have been one story arc.\n\nLast thing before I quit babbling here, this author is very good at cliff hangers.

Through a perilous and largely fruitless journey, Halt and Horace become more real, and through the dangers of slave-life, Evanlyn certainly develops as a character.\n\nThere are still scenes that shift points of view like earth moves during a quake, but I think I'm becoming immune to the annoyance.  The writing seems to have improved somewhat as well, albeit the actual story is slower paced.  Large sections of the second half of the book focus on Evanlyn, and poor Will hardly does much at all... that will certainly bore those in the young end of the YA audience who would prefer to see the hero split hairs with his bow and arrow.  However, as promised by those who have already read most of the series, this book is really only the first half of the story arc.  It could easily be combined into a larger volume, but marketing genius prevails.\n\nAs usual, the book is completely predictable, yet still enjoyable.  There is one place that could be seen as a continuity error, as the person making the observation could not know of certain events described, but not many people are really going to pay attention to that sort of thing.\n\nThis would NOT be the book to start with.  I asked the author if the books could be read out of order, and he replied in the affirmative.  However, I would not recommend doing that, as this book is largely about set up and development rather than action and adventure.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A1LI7KZH6VHPAQ", "ProductID": "B000Y2I7OK", "Review": "The primacy of personal relationships over loyalties to one's country or duty Spring arrives at the cabin high in the Skandian mountains where Evanlyn and Will have wintered. Will has shaken his addiction to the insidious warmweed, and Evanlyn has become comfortable with her new survival skills. One day she goes out to check their traps and does not return. Will, still weakened from the brutal life of a Skandian yard slave, goes looking for her, and their adventures begin --- again.\n\nJohn Flanagan's Ranger's Apprentice series began four books ago with THE RUINS OF GORLAN, about a young boy who is chosen to train to become a Ranger. Rangers function as their kingdom's intelligence-gathering agency, border patrol and guerrilla fighters. They are skilled in stealth, woodcraft and marksmanship. Their acutely trained reflexes, along with their tracking skills and the ability to go unnoticed in almost any environment, give them a reputation that borders on the uncanny.\n\nInitially, Will is disappointed not to be chosen for his kingdom's Battle School, where the knights of the realm are trained. But his respect and affection for Halt, the ranger to whom he is apprenticed, in addition to the role he plays in fighting the evil warlord Morgorath, soon have him committed to his role as apprentice ranger.\n\nThe first book in the series has all the hallmarks of typical sword and sorcery fantasy, with a classic good vs. evil conflict. But after Morgorath is defeated at the end of the second installment, THE BURNING BRIDGE, the adventure becomes more complex. Will and his companion Evanlyn are captured by Skandian raiders and become slaves in Skandia. It is only with the help of their captor Erak, who comes to admire the spirit of his young captives, that they are able to escape.\n\nThe changing loyalties that were a central piece of book three, THE ICEBOUND LAND, continue in THE BATTLE FOR SKANDIA. Will is reunited with his friends Halt and Horace, who left Araluen against their king's wishes to search for him and Evanlyn. They also discover the large army of Temujai --- fierce riders from the Asian steppes who seem to be based on the Mongols --- and must convince the Skandians to work with them to prevent the Temujai from overrunning Skandia and mounting an attack on Araluen.\n\nFlanagan's strengths as an author are his action sequences and battle strategies. His battle plans and descriptions of fights are so detailed they could easily be reenacted or plotted on a map. He also writes marvelous relationships between the characters. Horace and Will began as enemies, but their rivalry has evolved into a powerful friendship. Halt's gruff affection for Will is clear, and his clever manipulations of the other characters provide much of the book's plot. Erak, a Skandian raider, has emerged as one of the series' most entertaining characters --- alternately fierce and comedic. Evanlyn, who occupies the unenviable role of princess in disguise, holds her own with the other characters, who have often depended upon her for their survival.\n\nA common theme throughout the book is the primacy of personal relationships over loyalties to one's country or duty. This bears fruit when Erak's friendship with Will and his companions enables them to unite the Skandians and the Araluen slaves to fight against their common enemy --- the Temujai (portrayed as people who put their lives and loyalty to the common cause as secondary behind any personal relationships). With Erak's help and Halt's strategy, along with the skills of each of the companions, they mount a stirring defense against the mounted warriors.\n\nTHE BATTLE FOR SKANDIA will be enjoyed most by readers already familiar with the first three books in the series. But catching up should not constitute serious hardship for fans of fast-paced action/adventure.\n\n  --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood", "Feedback": "positive"}

The Ruins of Gorlan is Book One, and The Burning Bridge is Book Two. The setting is vaguely medieval Europe, with interesting details of battle, weapons, and character.\n\nRangers are a branch of service to the King of Araluen, skilled at woodcraft and longbow, and many people think they have a command of magic. Halt is a skilled Ranger, one of the best. He can disappear into a tree (or give that impression) and can fire a fatal arrow in seconds, even through the eye slit in a knight's visor. His apprentice, Will, and the young girl Evanlyn have escaped unscathed from a terrible battle, only to be caught by a raiding party of Skandians led by Jarl Erak. Halt is not allowed to go after them, so he arranges for the King to banish him for treasonous comments made in public, and he and the young knight Horace set off to Gallica, to find Will.\n\nThe chapters alternate between the stories of Will and Evanlyn as prisoners with the Skandians, and Horace and Halt on their trip through Gallica. Halt is old and very wise. He is able to teach the young knight Horace a thing or two about strategy and honor on their travels. Will is able to help Evanlyn during the short sojourn on the island of Skorghijl, waiting out the winter storms with the raiding party, and also keep up his spirits and fitness. But when they return to Jarl Erak's home of Hallasholm, Evanlyn is made a house slave, and Will becomes a yard slave, toiling in terrible cold until he becomes addicted to warmweed, and forgets who he is. Jarl Erak respects Will's bravery and skill, and hates to see him addicted and treated so poorly. He decides to help Will and Evanlyn try to escape.\n\nThis adventurous series is designed with cliffhangers at the end.  You will definitely want to read the coming books.

The language is lyrical. That's a start. I don't need a hard-hitting plot if I get caught up in the language. The author also does something funny with memory. You may not like this, but it's difficult to tell what actually occurs in the protagonist's life because her childhood memories are skewed, and she invents memories where there are none, or where her memories are confused.\n\nI relate to the main character, Veronica, because she's a disconnected female, and although some people want a solid history to understand how a woman gets to be so withdrawn from the physical world around her, I don't need tragic childhood events to explain away personality flaws. In fact, it annoys me when authors attempt to explain their characters' foibles with past events and family histories. This author pulls away from that. The reader (or this reader) never knows exactly why Veronica is screwed up, even though the protagonist, herself, searches for substantive reasons.\n\nWhat part of me did this book pique? I don't know-some part that responds to faith and hope. The narrator calls faith biological. Is it really? Is it caught up in the coding of what makes a person who she is? And do some people lack it? Do we need nothing more than the right words at the right time, or the wrong words at the wrong time to fill this biological urge? Is this the reason why some people believe in nonsense, because the wrong words filled them at the wrong moment? And is this why other people eschew faith, because it isn't in their biology?\n\nUltimately, this book left me feeling hopeful. I've read my share of literary books, and most of them are filled with hopelessness. The author could have ended this book in so many bad ways, and she chose not to.

She is a graduate of Trinity College Dublin, an ex-employee of RTE and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The Gathering was her fourth novel and won the 2007 Booker Prize.\n\n\"The Gathering\" is told my Veronica Hegarty, a 39 year old Dubliner. She's married to Tom and the couple have two daughters, Rebecca and Emily. As the book opens, word has just come through that one of Veronica's brothers, Liam, has committed suicide in Brighton. Liam had been struggling with a drink problem for years; Veronica suspects his problems may have stemmed from an incident in their childhood.\n\nWith \"The Gathering\", Veronica apparently aims to tell Liam's story...though \"to tell Liam's story, then I have to start long before he was born\". She begins in 1925, when her grandmother, Ada Merriman, first met Lambert Nugent. Lamb was smitten instantly, but - unfortunately for him - Ada went on to marry his friend Charlie Spillane.\n\nWhile Veronica may have wanted to tell Liam's story, by the end of the book I knew precious little about him - she focuses instead on Ada and Lamb, and a large part of that story appears to have come out of her own imagination. It also becomes obvious that she hates men in general, and Tom - her poor husband - appears to be utterly baffled as to where some of her comments are coming from. (It's never made clear where this hatred came from and I finished the book wondering exactly what had happened to Veronica). Somehow, she oblivious to her hatred, and apparently confuses poison and bitterness with insight and wisdom. She frequently refers to herself as \"the one who loved him [Liam] the most\" - a line that I found harder and harder to believe the more and more she said it. A struggle, and not a book I'd recommend - though I would say it was more deserving of the 2007 Booker Prize than \"On Chesil Beach\".", "Feedback": "negative"}

Enright mixes together the fallacy of memories in general, the particular fallibility of childhood memories, the malleability of the past, and the license a novelist has to create a \"memory\" for her characters.\n\nEnright's narrator (Veronica)is a middle-class Irish married woman with two children, a dozen siblings (each damaged in his or her own way), a mother who suffered a nervous breakdown during Veronica's childhood--and never quite recovered, and suffers from typical middle-age, middle-class angst. Enright adds hints of sexual abuse, and sets the entire story at a defining moment in Veronica's life--the suicide by drowning of her favorite brother, which in turn leads to a crisis in her own marriage.\n\nIn her attempt to discover the truth about her own life--she has discovered that she is living her life in \"inverted commas, as in going \"home\" to her \"loving\" husband, and having \"sex\"--she searches her memory, family lore, half remembered scenes from her childhood, and buried memories of her brother's sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend--and hints of repressed memories of her own abuse by that same friend.\n\nEnright succeeds in weaving together these multiple strands into a thoroughly readable story. That is not to say this is an easy read--Enright jumps in and out of the present without warning, and Veronica is at times apparently reliable, only to end up confessing that none of what she just described happened--or at least it probably didn't, or in any event, she has no idea if it did or not, but thinks it should have. But isn't that the way the mind really works--seamlessly weaving past, present and predicted future into what we call reality. Isn't that the basis of the Holy Trinity--via St. Augustine--only the present is real--the past is only a memory and thus exists only in your mind, and the future hasn't happened yet. However, you can slice time so finely, that the present moment is infinitesimally short...and thus really doesn't exist either. Yet we are undoubtedly real.\n\nSimilarly, while Enright's Veronica may not be sure what happened in the past, has only the vaguest grasp of what is going to come in the future, and is somewhat hazy on the here and now--the portrait which emerges is a very convincing one of a real family.\n\nHighly recommended.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Perhaps the problem lay in the fact that Enright chose to tell the story solely through Veronica's perspective, without any room for counter perspectives. It might also have worked if Veronica wasn't such a self-involved sex-obsessed/frustrated whiner who can't resist turning the focus on herself even as she tries to come to terms with her brother's suicide and the secret she thinks she holds which is responsible in some way for his untimely demise, and not just drink as was popularly believed.\n\nThrough it all, she shows her worst trying to deal with it, turning nasty to her loving husband and various other family members. One can't help but think of her as that irritating friend who loves an audience to her private drama, who relishes doling out unsavory morsels of her failings, and more importantly, how others' failings inevitably shaped hers. Even though she promises to tell her brother's story, she is more interested in how it affects her, in a case of 'enough about me, let's talk about ME!'\n\nThis continues in frustrating fashion so much so that by the time Veronica gets to the point some two-thirds of the novel, no one is particularly shocked or interested anyway, even as she edits and correct her version of what her saw to show how traumatised she is by the event.\n\nPerhaps Enright intended for her protagonist to be unreliable and detestable, in order to drive home the point that family histories are rarely simple and never reliable, and that it is always being rewritten and always changeable.\n\nTo Enright's credit, her prose is exacting and she does delve into Veronica's psyche with some precision, and one inevitably walks away from the book feeling moved in some way", "Feedback": "moderate"}

However, the evil twin of that pleasure is the unmitigated pain of wasting precious time slogging through something you can't stand. Unfortunately, not only does this Booker Prize-winner stand firmly in that second category, it is the champion of it: the most hated book of the 70+ I've read for my bookclub, and the least enjoyable work of fiction I've read this year (out of roughly 100 or so books).\n\nUnlike many other haters of this tedious book, I didn't find it particularly difficult reading. The unannounced shifts back and forth in time and place didn't leave me adrift so much as amazed at their clumsiness. Then again, the book is essentially a monologue of remembrance, and human memories are messy things, so I was willing to conditionally accept that messiness as part and parcel of the protagonist. Speaking of the protagonist (middle-aged Veronica Hegerty), many haters seem to focus on her unlikability as the source of the book's problems. Personally, I don't think that a protagonist needs to be likable in any way -- just interesting. But she's not interesting in the slightest, just (like the book itself), annoyingly self-indulgent. I suppose this could be construed as a kind of commentary on her yuppiesh generation, but that seems like grasping at straws. Moreover, there are no other characters to connect with. The entire story takes place within Veronica's head, and even though it's populated with various family members who allegedly mean so much to her (in a love/hate way), the reader never gets a sense of any of them.\n\nThe plot -- such as it is -- revolves around the suicide of one of Veronica's brothers, which sends her on a trip to Brighton to bring the body back to Ireland for the funeral (she is gathering the body to bring it back to a gathering of people -- clever). About halfway into the book the \"secret\" of this brother's lifelong depression is revealed, and it's both jaw-droppingly cliched and wholly simplistic and reductionist. My one hope was that this \"revelation\" would be the spark that lit a fire under the second half of the book -- but no, it simply plods forward at the same stultifying pace. Ultimately the book has nothing to offer: it has no telling insights into memory or regret, it rehashes the same tired cliches about growing up poor and Irish, its use of the unreliable narrator is rudimentary at best, and its not even notably bleak and depressing.

She is trying to gather her self, to see why her brother Liam died, and why he died the way he did.\n\nIn the beginning, intricate details of the sexual frustrations or abnormalities experienced by the middle-aged female narrator can be deemed at times as, \"more information than this reader wants to know.\" But, as the book progresses and the details of Nugent's sexual exploits with and to the members of the family become revealed, we realize that she, like the other Hegarties, have become perversely affected by the Nugent influence and constantly pervasive attendance at the familial premises.\n\nFocusing almost exclusively around the events within a fortnight of the death of brother Liam (with recollections scouring decades of family history), Veronica realizes at the very beginning,\"There is something wonderful about a death, how everything shuts down, and all the ways you thought you were vital are not even vaguely important.\"  Her children and husband can survive without her - leading her to think of suicidal thoughts (They don't need me anyway).\n\nBut, as you read further, suicide is not only a depressing concept to this family, but is the main reason for the family gathering at the brother Liam's wake.  And, as the large family congregates for the wake, she realizes that the family has cliques and more within its foundation. \"We do not always like the people we love - we do not always have that choice.\" \"We are born to love the people we otherwise would not care to know.\"\n\nDuring the ultra-depressing period of grieving's beginning, parts of Veronica's heart become encrusted. They lose life. Veronica Hegarty becomes distant from her husband, Tom. Not intentionally, but from her brother's death she loses a part of something.  She is another \"mad housewife\" - or at least temporarily so.

The book is told in a stream of consciousness style as Veronica, while responding to her brother's death and handling the details of retrieving his body from England, reflects upon her life and her family.  Some of her recollections, as Veronica admits in the first sentence of the book, may not be accurate as they are covered over by memory and self-interest. Veronica is thus something of an unreliable narrator, and Enright, the author, remains in the background without explicit comment.\n\nThis is a difficult book. The various Amazon reviews are thoughtful and perceptive, from those which rated the book a 5 to those which rated the book a 1. I learned something from many of the reviewers whose perspective on the book differs from mine.  I came away from my reading mostly disliking the book, and the views of many of my fellow reviewers confirmed my response.\n\n\"The Gathering\" has many poetical moments and beautiful turns of phrase. The narrator, Veronica, appears to make an attempt to be honest with herself.  Thus in the story we hear her views about her own life, her large family, parents, grandparents and siblings, and about her husband and children.  In particular, we hear a great deal about love, desire, and sex and Veronica's views of their interrelationships.  Veronica is bitter and angry.  The author presents her character for what she is to allow the reader to try to understand her.\n\nThe poetry and the toughness do not save the book.  Most of what Veronica says is too bitter and too angry to be interesting or insightful.  In fact, a great deal of it is an extreme form of male-bashing which, alas, differs only in degree from much discussion in recent years and which takes no large degree of courage to express.  Veronica is obsessed with male sexuality and lust  -- with the smell of a man, with the grossest details of a man's body parts, and with  a man's sexual activity.  She is angry with the way she feels men approach sex and this anger pervades her book far more than does the death of her brother. Her story is told through the fog of time and much of it remains elliptical.  But through much of the book, the theme appears to be that women are sullied by male sexuality at least in the form in which most men pursue sex. Their characters and feelings do not meet Veronica's expectations and approval.  The story includes long discussions on Veronica's grandmother, Ada, on her questionable early life, and on her relationship with her two suitors.  Veronica is also obsessed with the life of her parents -- and on their large family.  She attributes the large family and its difficulties to her father wanting too much sex with her mother -- as if, Veronica observes, he had a right to sex.  In her own life, Veronica remembers with fondness a Jewish boyfriend from America during her college years.  But she feels little for her husband and finds sex with him repellant in frequency, timing, and quality. He had the sex, she observes archly after one of their times together, I did not. Veronica also resents her husband his career success and her own leaving of the work place to raise her children.  Too much of this comes off as a screed and to much of it as a rehearsal of what have become commonplaces in some quarters. While I appreciated the attempt of the book to be frank and to speak honestly about one's feelings, I didn't think the book achieved these goals. I came away not caring much about Veronica.  And I had too many questions about her responses to her experiences and her insight to find her story compelling.\n\nI was reminded in this book of a recent American novel called, coincidentally enough, \"Veronica\" by the American writer Mary Gaitskill. This novel, like \"The Gathering\" is told in a first-person stream of consciousness style. (The narrator is a woman named Allison and the title character is her friend.)  Gaitskill's book is also full of tough reflections on sexuality, derived from Allison's life as a stripper and model. But I found Gaitskill's book, in which the sex is much more lurid than anything in \"The Gathering,\" had the personal voice, the immediacy, and the sense of honesty, that Enright's book aims for but for me failed to achieve.\n\nI struggled with \"The Gathering\" but couldn't bring myself to like or to recommend it.\n\nRobin Friedman", "Feedback": "moderate"}

But the title is misleading. What is being gathered together in this story is not primarily the various members of the Hegarty clan (although most of them make an appearance), but a rag-bag of childhood memories as Veronica struggles to make sense of her own life and Liam's in the context of family history. She makes this clear in the opening sentence: \"I would like to write down what happened in my grandmother's house the summer I was eight or nine, but I am not sure if it really did happen.\" Or sort of clear; her doubts about the past are part of the point.\n\nI had a disturbing sense of dj vu on picking up the paperback, because the pier on the cover closely recalls another recent Man Booker winner, Graham Swift's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LAST-ORDERS/dp/0679766626/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LAST ORDERS</a>, which is also about a gathering of family and friends to solemnize a death. And that first sentence seems to invade the territory of John Banville, whose most recent Man Booker winner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/THE-SEA/dp/0307263118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">THE SEA</a>, is also about recapturing the traumatic events of an Irish childhood. But I needn't have worried; Anne Enright's voice -- Veronica's voice -- is all her own: straightforward, witty, imaginative, yet bracingly honest, dwelling at one moment on skin and sweat, then cleansing it with gentle lyricism.\n\nVeronica's first-person narrative jumps around over four generations. The earliest passages tell how her grandmother Ada may have met her future husband; the latest ones extend some months beyond the funeral, and relate to her own family life with a college-lecturer husband and two daughters. Several things gradually become clear. First, that much of what Veronica narrates as fact may be misremembered, reconstructed, or the wholesale products of her imagination. Second, that her main concern is to trace the causes of her brother's failures, which we begin to recognize even through the glow of her fierce love for him. And third, that Veronica herself is also in trouble, struggling with a crisis in her own life and marriage, that only the act of writing may help her to resolve.\n\nDespite Veronica's problems and Liam's, this history of the Hegarty family is a counterpoint to the success story of Ireland during the past decades, as it has emerged from its backwater to become one of the leading engines of the new Europe. Veronica, who grew up sharing a bedroom with at least two other siblings, can now drive to an airport on a whim, present a credit card, and consider a flight halfway around the world. Anne Enright shares Penelope Lively's feeling for changing eras (as shown in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOON-TIGER/dp/0802135331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOON TIGER</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/CONSEQUENCES/dp/B000YT9DGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">CONSEQUENCES</a>), and equals her ability to take a relatively common story and render it far from ordinary through writing that pulses with life. And her technique of using chilhood memories to reflect a whole family history reminds me of Kate Atkinson's marvelous&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BEHIND-THE-SCENES-AT-THE-MUSEUM/dp/0312150601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE MUSEUM</a>, my touchstone for such books. But Enright's style is very much her own, and her people are well worth knowing for their own sake. Meet them.\n\n[I have now read a number of the mostly-negative Amazon reviews. Yes, this is a non-linear narrative, but I found that exhilarating rather than difficult. Others might be disturbed by the unreliability of the reporting, but it leads to some marvelous effects, such as the set-piece description of the meeting of Ada Merriman and Lambert Nugent in chapter 3 that is turned on its head in the last few sentences. It also makes it less a history of events than a psychological portrait of the narrator, which is surely the main point. As for the obsession with sexual organs, especially male ones, I see this in retrospect as a meaningful reflection of Veronica's trauma -- but I admit to being irritated at the time by what I took as merely a regrettable quirk of Enright's style.]", "Feedback": "positive"}

I think the former was easier to do than the latter in this case.\n\nUltimately, The Gathering's subject is the difficulty with trying to pin down the truth of anything, especially things that happened long ago for which there is little or no contemporary evidence. If you've never thought much about that issue, you'll enjoy the subtle philosophical bent of the novel.\n\nThat subject is explored in the context of a sister contemplating her brother's death. Veronica Hegerty is a very vivid and appealing character: Much of the book's charm comes from seeing her family through her eyes and memories. In the process, she reveals the kind of \"within the family\" opinions that all family members express in whispers with one another. Beneath her grief, Veronica also feels a need to share a secret with us . . . but she feels at a loss for how to do so. Her rambling reflections gradually spiral closer and closer to that secret until you realize its full shocking lesson: People may not be who they seem to be, and you need to be careful even where there seems to be no risk.\n\nThere's an unedited quality at times in the book that captures what will remind you of the sorts of soliloquies that we've all conducted in our minds. That exposition method is very effective for making Veronica's feelings come across more strongly.\n\nWhy did the book win the award? I'm not really sure. I found that the secret wasn't so very interesting as to make the philosophical question and the writing style worth the effort.

Later, however, when I put them down I find that I hardly remember what they had to say.\n\nThe Gathering is a little bit of the opposite experience. As I read, I was not at all sure what it was that I was supposed to be reading. It is fairly difficult to access, and not terribly forgiving of lapsed attention. Mostly I found myself saying to myself: \"Why? Why did this win the Man Booker Prize?\" But then somewhere towards the end, Enright pulls a magic trick. The book wraps itself up somehow, and is at once something shining. Something, dare I say it, which would like to fly. But still, I was not really sure that this was enough. It came so late in the book and what came before that moment was so leaden, I was not sure what I wanted to think. I mean, what I wanted to think about the overall experience.\n\nGiven time, the experience of reading the book has settled a little bit. I find that instead of growing more distant, I actually feel closer to the novel. I like it more. I have the impulse to buy another book by Enright. I am willing to forgive The Gathering its sharp edges and elbows.\n\nAnd boy oh boy does this book have sharp elbows. It is a bitter little pill of a novel. Just like its main character, it resists sympathy and identification. Enright uses fantasy, disjointed narrative, unpleasant people doing unpleasant things-- pretty much every device that you can imagine to force the reader back outside the text. It makes for such a strange combination because she writes with such lyrical prose and such a delicate hand that you expect to find the book yielding. The contrast is very interesting, but in the end I am not sure how successful The Gathering really is-- largely for that reason.\n\nI remain surprised that it won the Man Booker Prize. I took a look at the reviews on Amazon, and am not shocked to find them universally savage. An Irish female writer dealing with the subject of a dysfunctional family has a certain flavor to it-- carries a load of expectation. Those poor readers who go into it expecting The Book of Ruth or some other typical Oprah pick are going to be angry, not just disappointed. Some bad things happen, but often the narrator is just cranky. You are not allowed to feel that you have understood the past; sometimes the main character just makes things up. No catharsis, no redemption, no Irish brogue. The prose is pretty, but pretty like a snake in the grass is pretty. It glitters and it hisses and it does not really let you touch its skin.\n\nThis book reminds me of myself in truly black rages-- when I want to share nothing with nobody and go through the past as though I were reading a grocery list. In those moods, I would pull the head off of anyone who tried to sympathize or pretended to understand. This book has the mean reds.\n\nBut then that lightness at the end-- I don't know. I still need to think about this one a while longer.\n\nIn summary, for me, interesting. I am impressed, but have doubts. Please be aware of what you are getting before you start to read the novel. There is nothing worse than biting into what you think is a raspberry and getting a wasabi pea. Think bitter and think dark and you will be better prepared.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Anne Enright's \"The Gathering\" has got to be the worst ever novel to have been awarded the prestigious Booker Prize. What was the award committee even thinking of when they shortlisted it from among possibly hundreds of other worthy titles ? What could they have seen in this rather unexceptional if not downright boring tale about a large damaged Irish family that led them to name it the best work of fiction for 2007 ? The Booker has been rather erratic in its choices in recent years. Unless this trend is arrested, it will become increasingly irrelevant in influencing what serious readers will eventually read.\n\nStories about damaged families are a firm favourite with English/Irish writers. Nothing wrong with that if the author has a half decent or interesting story to tell and tells it well. John Banford's \"The Sea\", another Booker winner from the recent past, is a good example.  Sadly, on both counts, \"The Gathering\" fail rather miserably. The narrator Veronica's voice is so cryptic, judgmental, and unpleasant I found it hard to lend her a sympathetic ear. She's a self-centred bore and an interminable whiner. It's always her parents' or her siblings' fault. For example, she blames her mother - for what I'm not sure - and still don't know for sure by the end of the story. She criticizes her big brother Ernest who joined the priesthood then dropped out for being a hypocrite, etc etc. She's so devastated and numbed by her brother Liam's suicide she puts her relationship with her husband on hold for reasons we can only guess at - he's too interested in his career (is that a bad thing ?) and maybe had a couple of affairs on the side. The so-called family secret is also such a pathetic clich I almost gave up when it is revealed two thirds of the way through. Not that it isn't a terrible crime, just that it isn't nearly enough to hang a story on.\n\nWorst of all is Enright's prose. It's choppy, awkward, and ugly. Those one word sentences that punctuate the pages. How pretentious ! That noir-ish seduction scene at the hotel lobby when grandma Ada and her lover first laid eyes on each other is just plain absurd. Instead of sensing the sparks, I thought \"how unlikely\"!\n\nThen I suddenly recall there was one book I read two pages of and then abandoned because I couldn't stand the writing and that turned out to be (also) Enright's \"What Are You Like ?\" Maybe Anne Enright just doesn't agree with me.

But this incident has caused Veronica to widely reminisce about her entire life, beginning from the time when she, at age eight, and Liam were shipped off to her grandmother Ada's house to her highly unsettled marriage.\n\nVeronica turns a harsh light on life in general, refusing to be taken in by the platitudes and convenient fictions of life. A main theme is her rather cynical view of sexuality, from male genitalia to the predominance of exploitation. In some cases she finds love to be a form of hate. In addition, the uncomfortable communication at Liam's wake hardly supports the notion of families as primary entities for emotional support.\n\nMost of the story is rather difficult to follow as the author abruptly switches among locales, generations, and characters. Because much of the book is in the form of what Veronica remembers, the question invariably arises of whether events actually occurred or are imagined.\n\nThe book is a slow read.

However much of the book was so  verbose that I found it a struggle to maintain attention.\n\nThe author also has an obsession with sex and genitalia which crops up throughout the book, often in a way that felt gratuitous - for example, did we really need a man at the church with an erection?  Or a description of her husband's scrotum while he's sleeping?  Or of her grandfather's physical reaction to meeting her grandmother?  (In fairness to Enright, halfway through the book there is the revelation of an incident in the narrator's part which partially explains this obsession - but even so!

Her character, Veronica, one of the Hegarty clan, has word of her brother, Liam's death, and she is on her way to claim his body. On her way she reminisces about the family and builds layer upon layer of the family members that we meet. Her prose is such that you are either intimidated by its mastery or drawn into the brilliance of the descriptions of the family and need to know the stories. And, the stories are there and come one by one as I said, built layer upon layer so that you finally come to know the feelings and needs of them all. Maybe too much of the feelings for some. Veronica, facing her own self shies away from her family and wraps herself in the waves of emotion that come her way. Anne Enright writes about love and sexual desire and as she says \"One of the things I wanted to do in the book was explore how desire and hatred are closely bound up,\" says Enright. \"You know, that sense that someone - usually a man - is enraged by the fact that he desires someone - usually a woman.\"\n\nI cannot in all honesty divulge much of the book. It must be read and devoured and instilled in the mind to set for later discussion. In Al Kennedy's review in 'The Guardian' he shares this nugget: \"The chairman of the Booker judges, Howard Davies, revealed that he had spotted the brilliance of this novel when he said: \"It has an absolutely brilliant ending. It has one of the best last sentences of any novel I have ever read.\" Al Kennedy goes on to say that \"mortality becomes the ultimate definition of Love's stupidity - an outpouring of energy towards people who are always destined to disappoint, to be disappointed and, above all, who are compelled to leave us in the most devastating way, by dying. The horror and wonder of love, we are shown, is that it outlives its object.\"\n\nWonderfully, Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-30-07", "Feedback": "positive"}

Liam, the closest sibling to her, both in age (he is eleven months older) and in affection, has died. She has the sad task of making all the burial arrangements that include telling their frail, aged mother. The surviving members of this wildly dysfunctional clan meet for a wake (the gathering) so realistic that it will break your heart.\n\nAt one point the narrator says that all big families are the same. Enright has made the Hegartys (she has a dozen ways to desribe the blue of their eyes) symbolic of every large family: those the parents favored, those they didn't, the messers (Liam), the drunks, the most successful, the religious one, the mysterious one, the brightest. This family calls to mind another large family in Thomas Wolfe's 1939 novel LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL. The narrative, as the Queen would say in Alan Bennett's recent novel THE UNCOMMON READER, does not progress as the crow flies but rather meanders in and out among three generations of this crazed and in some ways doomed family.\n\nThere are family secrets revealed along the way including one that may explain why some of the characters do what they do; on the other hand we cannot be sure since memory is never completely reliable. Enright's haunting prose is also often beautiful.

And if you can, at nineteen, count the people you love on one hand, you will not, at forty, have run out of fingers on the other.\" On the other hand, you do not always like the people you love. One of the most touching scenes out of many occurs when Veronica's old mother finally goes to bed the night that her son Liam lies in a coffin in the downstairs living room.

He was probably born in A.D. 69--the famous 'year of four Emperors'--when his father, a Roman knight, served as a colonel in a regular legion and took part in the Battle of Baetricum.\n\nSuetonius became a scribe and noted secretary to the military set, eventually ending up in the service of Hadrian, who was emperor from A.D. 117-138. He was dismissed for 'indiscreet behaviour' with Hadrian's empress, Sabina, but not before doing sufficient research to complete many books of a historical nature. His attempts at philosophy were much less well received, and most of his history has been overlooked by all but classical scholars, but this work, 'The Twelve Caesars' has held the imagination of more than just the scholarly set since it was first written.\n\nSuetonius had the good fortune of speaking to eyewitnesses from the time of the early Caesars. Much of his information about Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero in fact comes from those who observed and/or participated in their lives. Suetonius is in many ways more of a reporter than an historian--he would record conflicting statements without worrying about the reconciliation (this set him apart from Tacitus and other classical historians who tried to find a consistency in stories and facts.\n\nSuetonius has been described as the tabloid journalist of ancient Rome, because not only did he not appear to check facts (which in fact is not true--he did check, he just didn't try to smooth over the conflicting facts), but he choose to concentrate on the private lives, motivations and personality quirks of his subjects rather than their grand plans, policies and military/political victories. Thus, many details of the lurid scene appear. Suetonius, and this volume in particular, formed much of the basis for Robert Graves as he wrote 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God', which in turn pulled up the popularity of Suetonius in this generation.\n\nSuetonius had first hand knowledge of many of the Caesars who followed the Claudians, and ready access to the archives of the imperial family and the Senate, given his imperial posting.\n\nThis translation is not intended to be a faithful rendering of the language (which might well result in a stilted English construct) but rather a faithful account of the stories Suetonius tells. Graves has taken the liberty of changing monetary, date, and technical terms into standard English measurements of close kinship of meaning.\n\nFor the record, the twelve Caesars, about whom Suetonius writes, are:\n\n+ Julius Caesar\n\n+ Augustus\n\n+ Tiberius\n\n+ Gaius Caligula\n\n+ Claudius\n\n+ Nero\n\n+ Galba\n\n+ Otho\n\n+ Vitellius\n\n+ Vespasian\n\n+ Titus\n\n+ Domitian\n\nSuetonius held nothing back in writing about the personal habits of the emperors and their families, nor did he hold back in his moral judgement of them. Of Tiberius, for instance, he wrote that Tiberius did so many other wicked deeds under the pretext of reforming public morals--but in reality to gratify his lust for seeing people suffer--that many satires were written against the evils of the day, incidentally expressing gloomy fears about the future.... At first Tiberius dismissed these verses as the work of bilious malcontents who were impatient with his reforms and did not really mean what they said. He would remark: 'Let them hate me, so long as they fear me!' But, as time went on, his conduct justified every line they had written.\n\nGraves' edition of Suetonius is available under many covers, from hard-back study editions to Penguin paperbacks, including a wonderful, finely printed edition by the Folio Society. Take a step back into the seemier side of ancient Rome, the side most history courses overlook in favour of more traditional historical events, and hie thee to the bookstore for this work.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Are the series of events that unfold unrealistic, especially when you consider the time period in which the story is set...yes!  But who cares?  The story has a sweet romance, and hot sex.  Furthermore it's well written, and the characters are likeable.\n\nStella is traveling by wagon train, from Virginia to California, with her sister.  At one of the stops, she ambles off to bathe in a stream that isn't too far the from camp.  Standing Bear happens upon Stella as she lounges naked by the stream.  Of course he decides to keep her, and the chase is on.  Next thing you know he's got her tied to a tree and has his way with her.\n\nStanding Bear is determined to keep Stella with him as his woman; he even renames her Pale As Moonlight.  However, relations between Whites and Indians is such that he has to consider the potential consequences to his people, should he kidnap a White woman.  When his companions join him and Stella, he is forced to let her go...for now.  From there the story progresses to its conclusion, complete with HEA.\n\nThe love that develops between Stella and Standing Bear occurs almost instantaneously and is not very convincing, just as the series of events that unfold once Stella returns to the wagon train, are somewhat unrealistic.  Moreover, the ending is too convenient.  Nonetheless, if you are willing and able to suspend disbelief for a little while, this story makes for a thoroughly entertaining read.

The indian hero wants to take the white girl captive but can't because it might ruin trade with a passing wagon train and cause his village to get attacked....what?

Then on the actual day of the trade the indian's white aunt who used to be a captive comes with the indians and none of the white people raise a fuss about them having a white woman.  The white aunt then convinces the entire wagon train to let the girl marry the hero in the spirit of promoting peace between both people.  The prejudice white people not only allow it, there's a priest on hand who willingly performs the ceremony and then and there and they live happily ever after.  The whole story was idiotic and contrived.\n\nAnd if none of that sounds stupid enough to you, how about the part where the indian hero of the story makes butt beads out of vine and berries and sticks them in the heroine's butt to spice things up.

Standing Bear sat silently on his horse mesmerized by the movements of the young woman. He had decided to take her as his captive. His Woman!

Nikos tells Anna that he would never lover her or be faithful and he plans on revenge due to the fact that he tried to still his baby from him. but as time goes on he finds out how possessive he his towards Anna and the baby. There are some really cute scenes with him, Anna and the baby where he is learning to hold the Michelle.

He wants revenge, he wants his son and most of all he desires and is determined that he and Anna will marry and raise their son together.  How will he convince her?  Your heart will stop as you read about this very sexy and determined man's plan, a plan to have that family of his own, to be the father he himself had never had.  However, his plan did not include love because Nikos believed to love would make him weak!\n\nAnna can't believe Nikos wants to marry her.  How can he think it would work when she left him months before because she thought he was having an affair with his new secretary?  Anna had once been Nikos PA and loved the job and working for him.  She didn't count on falling in love with him, becoming his mistress and expecting his baby.  When she found out she was pregnant, everything changed.....Nikos insisted she quit her job and stay at home until the baby was born.  When she thought he was having an affair, she left and had her baby on her own.\n\nThere are other issues involved as well.......her father had worked for Nikos and one learns later that he stole from Nikos, was badly in debt and also owed money to a family friend and Anna's past employer, Victor.  To top it off, Anna's mother has also been borrowing money from Victor and the debt is astronomical.\n\nIn the end, many lessons are learned by both Niko and Anna as to what really matters in life......mainly love and family.  The Greek Billionaire's Baby Revenge is action packed, very sensual and passionate, an all around outstanding and exceedingly pleasing read, one the reader will remember for a long time.", "Feedback": "positive"}

I had all settled in for a decent \"sword and sorcery\" piece, but my expectations were certainly subverted at the plot twist and genre change right about at the halfway point.  The main character demonstrates no small amount of resourcefulness throughout, but what drew me most was the relationship she builds (and then has to rebuild) with her \"sister\".  While I believe the cliffhanger this book ends on does set up nicely for the next one, I came away wanting a greater sense of closure.  A TV series might have a season finale end on a cliffhanger, but I think of a novel series like this more like a movie with several sequels planned.  Each movie with sequels I've enjoyed has given the audience something to look forward to in the next one but also gave some sense of closure of the story arc within.  At the time of the closing scene of this book, I observed no reflection by any of the characters regarding great victories or triumphs or even deep insights or appreciations.  There was some pretty heavy stuff laid on our heroine right at the end.  I would have liked to have read more about how it impacted her emotionally at a guttural level, driving her to set forth anew at the start of the next book with a renewed sense of purpose (and an axe to grind!)", "Feedback": "positive"}

J.L. Langley does that with this hero and does it well. Jake is a handsome, Native American, biker, PI, gay, werewolf Alpha. How can you resist? He finds his forever mate in Remi, a newly made werewolf. Remi's so far in the closet he's in the next room. After a lifetime of terror and abuse at the hands of his father, Remi has blanked out any feelings he ever had for men. His life revolves around doing whatever his father demands in order to protect his younger brother from the abuse he endured. As he opens up to Jake, buried memories surface that put everyone he loves in danger.\nThis is part of a series but can be read as a standalone.

He wanted him to get used to the idea of being a werewolf, plus Remi has issues coming to terms of his own sexuality.\n\nHe has a very strong attraction to Jake and wants to submit to him whenever he is around him. Even though his body responds to him, it takes a little bit longer for him to come to accept it. But when he finally does, their relationship starts to grow and become stronger. There are a few suprises held out for Remi and Jake, with Remi being a werewolf now. Along with their relationship growing, this story is also about Remi and his younger brother Sterling. It is almost two stories coinsiding with each other.\n\nRemi gets Jake and his partner Rhys' help investigating his father. Remi's dad is a abusive and a total jerk. He wants to get Dirk(his dad) in jail and help save his younger brother and mother from his abusive grasp. Remi is like a father figure to Sterling. Remi is much older than his younger brother. His brother is only turned 15 at the end of this book.\n\nAs they are digging up dirt on Dirk and keeping Sterling safe, Remi ends up remembering things that will help put Dirk behind bars. He has surpressed memories that come to surface.\n\nSPOILER ALERT!!\n\nHis brother ends up being Rhys' mate.

The only thing that I didn't really like was Remi's submission to Jake: it was pretty hot to read, but I think it was overdone sometimes, the way they switched to the sub/dom mode wasn't always smooth, but it's really a preference of mine and it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.\n\nRemi's relationship with his brother Sterling was the best part of the book, you could really see how much they cared for each other and looked after each other. Sterling is young and full of energy and he stole the scene every time he appeared. I'm really looking forward to Sterling and Rhys' book. It was funny to see how this big bad guy was always ready to run to protect Sterling. I'm waiting for Sterling to finally grow up, even if he's quite a handful already.\n\nI was quite surprised by Remi, because in the second book he didn't appear like a positive character and I thought it would be hard for him to accept his new werewolf nature and I thought he would fight against his attraction to Jake much more. At the beginning he justified it with the fact that mating was a werewolf thing, something beyond his control. I appreciated very much when, while recalling his past, he realized that it was just something he has always had in himself.

Though it is a continuing story, it branches off into a character that did not play a very large role in the first book nor was he highly thought of...  We discover this character--Remi--to be far deeper and more complex than we had imagined! The tragedies in the telling of the tale are compelling and the dynamic between the werewolf aspect as well as his dominate/submissive relationship with his mate Jake, are among my favorite qualities of this novel!

Now he's trying to deal with the impulses of his new wolf nature, and it isn't helping his peace of mind that every time he gets anywhere around private investigator Jake Romero, Remi can't control his arousal. Finding out Jake is the one who saved his life by turning him werewolf and that Jake is his mate answers many of Remi's questions, but his little brother Sterling shows up, bruised and scared, and gives Remi a terrifying reminder of the consequences of being true to himself - and who would pay the most brutally for it.\n\nRemi's haunted by a recurring dream he doesn't fully understand, full of yearning for his mate, and desperately trying to save his little brother from their father. Being wolf has only complicated a difficult, tenuous existence. One that his father seems intent on ending.\n\nWith a much smoother narrative, more realistic dialogue, and a deeper, more complex story, Langley has improved greatly on her With or Without series in this second installment. Remi and Jake are good together, and Remi's brother Sterling is utterly charming (high point of the book for me). Jake's partner Rhys and his friends are all strong secondary and ancillary characters, and the threat of Remi's father is far more intense and well developed than the suspense aspects of the previous book. Remi's past is brutal and heartbreaking, and the effects on his personality and character are realistic and traumatic. All in all the characters are likable and the story is sound.\n\nI did have a few issues, though. Remi and Jake were introduced in the previous book and while Jake was at most an ancillary character, Remi was more of a secondary character and was given more story time. The Remi of that book is virtually unrecognizable in this one, though. Some of his less pleasant actions and reactions in that one are explained, but there isn't enough to warrant the complete shift of personality to a loving, giving person who's first and last concern is for his brother. I liked him a lot more, don't get me wrong, but the inconsistency in his character was a problem for me.\n\nI also had a few problems with how Jake and Remi, and by extension, their friends and pack, dealt with the very serious threat of Remi's father. Not to mention my utter disgust over Remi's mother's willingness to stay in such a violently abusive relationship. It's tragically realistic - happens every day - but it's not something that makes for a pleasant read. And frankly, with so many werewolves around, I just couldn't understand why Remi's father didn't \"accidentally\" end up as dead as he deserved before the situation degenerated to the degree it did. Especially with the lives of Sterling and their mom on the line. It's not like precedent hadn't been set in the first book to allow for killing in self defense.\n\nAs I've indicated in other reviews, my personal preferences for M/M romantic and sexual relationships trends away from dom/sub behavior and relationships, and that is theme in the sexual relationship between Jake and Remi. On top of that, Remi's willing submission further created an inconsistency in his personality between this book and the first. On a more pleasing note, Remi wasn't effeminate, nor as generally submissive in nature as Keaton was in the first book, even with his Omega status in the pack, so that helped. The surrounding story and the appeal of the characters allowed me to still enjoy the book, even with those issues.\n\nI was pleased to visit J.L. Langley's site and find out that the next book in the With or Without series is complete and with Langley's editor. If things go as indicated on her site, that book, WITH ABANDON, will be available in December of this year. I'm looking forward to it, but even more so Sterling and Rhys' book, WITHOUT FEAR, which is in production but on hold at the moment. There's just something about Langley's characters and the world that she's created here for this series that are appealing to me, even with the issues I had with this one and the last. More books in the series is good news.\n\nWarning: This book contains graphic and explicit (and hot!)

{"ReviewerID": "A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP", "ProductID": "B000ZKECCW", "Review": "A sexy exciting adventure When Remington Lassiter was attacked by a rogue werewolf in \"Without Reservation\", J.L. Langley's previous novel, he was left shredded and near-death. Jake Romero, a werewolf who had been acting as a bodyguard for Keaton in that story, found Remi, recognized him as his mate, and gave Remi his blood to heal him. This also turned Remi into a werewolf himself. Remi was raised by an abusive father who is horribly homophobic. Remi tries to protect his younger brother Sterling from the father since Sterling still lives at home. Should Remi do anything to anger his father Dirk, it will be taken out on the Sterling. Unfortunately, Remi's closest friends are gay, and merely visiting them will anger the father.\n\nTo also add complications to his life, he is a new werewolf who has little control over the sensations and transformations that come along with being one. The most disrupting of the traits is that Jake Romero is Remi's mate. Everybody has a mate, the one person in the world that complements that person in every possible way. Even though Remi is straight, being near Jake arouses him and overwhelms him with emotions that he not only has no control over, but which he doesn't understand.\n\n\"With Caution\" is a fine complement to \"Without Reservation\". The main characters of Remi and Jake were introduced in that novel, and in this one, we get to see them mature and step into their new roles. J. L. Langley manages to mix excitement, danger, and eroticism all seamlessly, adding in a bit of humor when needed. It's enthralling to see Remi faced with pure lust and attraction for Jake, but not understanding why since he's straight. We spend quite a bit of time in Remi's head, and we learn his motivations and empathize with him. Jake is also a complex character in a difficult situation. He knows Remi is his mate, and the attraction is just as strong for him as it is for Remi. Jake is also a very dominant Alpha, and his first instinct is to throw Remi down and make him submit, but such an act on the unready Remi will merely scare him away. Jake walks a fine line between staying near enough to Remi to gain his trust, but still keep his arousal and instincts under control.\n\nRemi's brother Sterling is a wonderful character, one of more endearing ones I've read in fiction. Fourteen years old, accepting, exuberant, irrepressible, chronically inquisitive and talkative, he is a wonderful kid and it's very clear why everyone who meets him goes out of their way to protect him. He is absolutely dear to the story.\n\nThe story is interesting and this interpretation of the werewolf genre is very well thought out. The pacing is very good. Just when you start to feel the story is getting too comfortable, a surprising twist is thrown in that livens it up again.\n\nIt's a hot, steamy, exciting piece of paranormal male romance.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Jake's pack is awesome; I really enjoyed reading about their camaraderie and their loyalty to each other.\n- The beginning of yet another story with the same characters that I am (im)patiently waiting for Langley to release. She does an excellent job setting up another romance toward the end of the current volume--Jake and Remi are introduced at the end of Without Reservations and then have their own volume in With Caution. I very much hope that the two characters who are introduced at the end of this book have their own story coming soon.\n- Jake is lovely. I like the idea of an uber-masculine man caring deeply about someone else and turning to putty when the other person is around; this is why I'm so anxious to see whether Langley follows through with the next romance in the series in particular.\n\nCONS:\n- The BDSM stuff struck me as odd. Granted, I know nothing of the lifestyle except what I've read in books, so if you're an expert on the scene, please excuse my ignorance here. But Jake and some of the other characters think of Remi as the ultimate submissive, and I didn't see much in his actions that went beyond superficial, vanilla submission (nothing like the soul-searching that occurs in the Deviations books, for example). It could be that this book just depicts a less severe level of the lifestyle than some of the others I've read, except that the characters in this story refer a few times to \"earning leathers.\"\n- One semi-voyeuristic sex scene that's bizarre and made me a little uneasy while I was reading it.\n- The story's villain is about as one-dimensional as they come: he's evil and disgusting and horrible...so much so that his continued cruel actions repeatedly drew me out of the story. I kept thinking, \"At least show me a reason why he's so single-mindedly vicious.\"\n\nOverall comments: I've read other m/m romances that swept me off my feet more than the stories in this series, but these are wonderful when read together.

I got caught up in the  mystery as it unraveled (though I saw the younger brother's situation from a mile off... I think the revelation of that could have been planned better). I think the highest praise comes in the form of how the author treats the Native American influence. She presents it well but doesn't feel the need to invent things about the culture if she doesn't know anything about them (as a native man I am particularly sensitive to how natives are portrayed in novels/media) so job well done on that count alone.\n\nThe only other thing that got to me was that the author used the term 'slanted' when writing about two men approaching a kiss. 'Slanted?' Really? You couldn't come up with a better term or at least alternates that could be cycled so that particular word didn't appear tagged onto each male/male kiss?\n\nAll n' all a good guilty pleasure read.

I started with With Caution, which actually I think helped me appreciate the first book more. While I enjoy J.L. Langley's style of writing, I think that With Caution is the weaker of the two books. Jake Romero is a great original character and she gets him right, but in trying to create more of a back-story for Remington Lassiter, J.L. Langley went askew.\n\nRemington is a badly written, feminized character who seemingly needs a man to either abuse him or save him. I found neither appealing. While the sex scenes between Jake and Remi were hot, the pairing of these two men would have better served if the author had made Remington less feminine and more of an equal with Jake. She did that perfectly with Chay and Keaton in Without Reservations. Even though Keaton was described as \"Little Bit,\" and small in stature, he still was a masculine man who could stand up to his lover (Chay) and all of members of the wolf pack. Somehow, the author lost that in the Remington characterization and instead went the way of Japanese sterotypes of seme and uke. That is a shame, as I would have enjoyed this book so much more without those generalizations in the plot.\n\nWhile I could not give this book a 5-star rating, I did enjoy the series overall.

The characters that she created in \"Without Reservations\" appear and continue to develop, especially Jake and Remi.  Langley made clear that they were intended mates in the previous book, but kept Remi from discovering that fact.  He learns it early on here and Langley does a good job of developing a credible plotline for the two to become lovers and mates, and much more.  I won't give any more away other than to say their relationship affects their wolfpack in ways that show Langley developing the \"rules\" and \"facts of life\" for her fictitious werewolves in ways that were not clear in either of her two previous works in this series.  In fact, the reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that in several ways, characters in earlier works were not consistent with some of the \"rules\" she brought out in this work.  Also, the Remi we see (and become quite fond of) in detail in this book is consistent with the Remi we saw late in \"Without Reservation,\" but does not seem like the same character who pitched a royal fit when he walked in on Chay and Keaton making love in the earlier work.  That made me a bit uncomfortable in the last book, but it worries me more in this one.  Still, both quibbles are minor, enough to downgrade slightly to four or four and a half stars (instead of five), but the characters are a delight, many interesting new ones introduced, a despicable villain introduced, and the way paved for at least one more (probably a whole series) of additional books in this universe.  If you like Langley, you'll enjoy this book and should buy it.", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A2ZGPU1SNRD9L7", "ProductID": "B000ZKECCW", "Review": "Loved With Caution This story opens at the end of Without Reservations. Remington Lassiter has just been turned and he is trying to cope with being a were at the same time as he is fighting his attraction to Jake Romero, the werewolf who turned him to save his life. He is deeply conflicted between what he wants and what he feels is right. To complicate matters he knows that if he does anything to offend his father, such as enter into a relationship with another man, both he and his younger brother Sterling would pay. But every time he sees Jake there is a bond and an attraction between them that he can't overcome. After seeing how difficult it is for Remi to control his feelings Jake has no option but to tell him that he is his mate. At that point Remi realizes that he is fighting a losing battle and he gives in to his growing feelings for Jake.\n\nWhen I first met Remi in Without Reservations he was the somewhat homophobic best friend of Chayton Winston, a veterinarian and mate of Keaton Reynolds. Initially it was difficult for me to accept Remi in a gay relationship as well as the change in his personality, however the author provided a plausible explanation for his change of mind about Chay's and Keaton's relationship as well as the major shift in his own sexual orientation. It seems that Remi had a deep, dark secret that he had never admitted to himself or anyone else until it's almost too late.\n\nRemi is the poster child for abused children. His father is a psychopath whose idea of fun is terrorizing his family and because he is a Rez Policeman with lots of power no one dared question him until Jake shows up on the scene. Remi's character is very vulnerable and submissive and the hint of BDSM in the story went well with his persona. I really felt for him in his fight to protect his brother and his mother, while at the same time keeping his relationship with Jake a secret from his father. His turnaround in standing up to his father was precipitated when Sterling shows up with bruises on his body and he knows that he can't close his eyes any longer to the abuse, so he asks Jake to help him bring his father to justice.\n\nThis book is extremely complex and the characters are much richer than its predecessor. The emotion throughout the book was at a very high pitch and at times I felt as if my stomach was in knots because the action was non stop. There is so much going on it's difficult to know where to stop in terms of talking about the storyline because of the danger of being a spoiler. There is a murder investigation, extreme violence against members of Remi's family, a horrifying incident in the past, collusion between law enforcement agencies in an investigation several years ago, as well as a recent tragedy, all of which heighten the pressure in the already intense love story between Remi and Jake.\n\nThe sex in this book is so emotive and wonderful between the couple that I could feel the air between them crackle. When J.L. Langley writes a love scene, and that is what she did with Jake and Remi because it wasn't just sex, you are drawn into the minds of these three dimensional characters who tug at your heart strings. The other characters were engaging - from Rhys, Jake's business partner and best friend, young Sterling, Remi's brother who thinks Rhys is hot, and all the others who rounded out the story and made it such an incredible read.\n\nThis book is not a standalone and to really enjoy the series the stories should be read in order. Did I love With Caution? I have to give an unequivocal and resounding \"yes\". Buy this book.", "Feedback": "positive"}

Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language, violence, hot nekkid man-love.  What more could you want in some m/m fiction?\n\nYou first meet the somewhat unenlightened Remi in Without Reservations. He is angry and angsty and not at all impressed with his best friend Chay's choice in partner. After being turned into a werewolf in this 1st book he is working on being the best were he can be and look out for his younger brother. The relationship between Remi and his brother Sterling is central to the book and a lot of Remi's motivations and decisions revolve around being there for the younger sibling. He is such a great character always making sure Sterling has somewhere safe to go and be away from their abusive father. Under all that front is a sweet guy. There is also a mystery that unfolds involving Remi's past. I think if I had read Without Reservations 1st I would have perhaps not warmed up to Remi as quick as I did. He is cocky and has this veneer of bravado but he is also very sweet and loving. One of my favourite characters.\n\nJake is just sex on a stick as far as I am concerned. He is hot, a PI and has a serious jones for Remi who is finding being a werewolf and attracted to another man all a bit confusing. Jake is protective, loving and super Alpha. He also has a motorbike AND a leather jacket. Which I kinda liked as I spent most of my 3rd year of high school drooling over the guy in front of me with the leather jacket. Merroow. Jake is a total top and there is just a wee bit of BDSM and much smex.\n\nI really liked this book and also the others in the series. Probably a good idea to read them in order, or if you're a rebel like me pay no attention to order whatsoever and be totally taken in by a nice cover! Very groovy reading from one of my favorite authors.

He was made a werewolf by Jake, who is also his mate but hesitant to reveal the fact.  But, the real reason behind Remi's attitude is heartbreaking and shocking.  Physical abuse from his father was hinted at in the previous installment, but now the truth is fully revealed.\n\nThis book does stand alone, but a reader will benefit from reading the previous ones.  While I really enjoyed the last one, this book has more depth and much richer character development, especially in Remi.  He is flawed, loving, vulnerable and in need of someone to care for him for a change.  Jake is that person, but first they both must deal with the very real danger Remi's brother Sterling is in from their abusive father, Dirk.  In their efforts to find evidence against Dirk so they can take Sterling away, Jake and Remi uncover a mystery revolving around an incident when Remi was a teen.  And incident so horrifying, Remi's mind completely blocked it out - except for the dream he keeps having.  There is a lot of action regarding the mystery, and plenty of Langley's trademark hot sex.  Langley also expands on her werewolf mythos, with new insight into alpha and omega status within the pack.

There is a lot to enjoy here in addition to the romance.\n\nMy only disappointment with this novel, and it was a small one, was the very predictable storyline with Sterling.  Warning, small SPOILER:\n\nSterling is beaten nearly to death and is saved by being made a werewolf by his mate.  This is exactly what happened to Remi in the last book in order to segue into his story!  So, the next book will likely be Sterling's romance.  However, this was a minor hitch and doesn't make me want to read Sterling's story any less.  I just wish it had been done differently, maybe as a choice this time.  Langley did throw in a great surprise concerning Sterling that should make the next book more interesting.\n\nOverall, this was a wonderful paranormal M/M romance.  I will definitely be buying this in paperback come summer so I can re-read it. Highly recommended!", "Feedback": "positive"}
{"ReviewerID": "A1E481YU3ZPK6S", "ProductID": "B000ZKECCW", "Review": "With Caution by J.L. Langley A J.L. Langley's book is a sure reading. You will find a good story, hot sex, a lot of humor and romance for your heart. Yesterday I bought three books, but when I had to choose from what book start my reading, I had no doubt: J.L. Langely will not deceive me\n\nWith Caution is the third in the With or Without series, even if it is strict connected only with Without Reservation. Remi was turned in werewolf by Jake in the first enstallment in the series, and he has now to learn how to live like a werewolf and in a pack. In the Chay and Keaton's story, Remi had expressed a lot of doubts and a lit of homophobic behaviour, and so when Jake had turned him and discovered that Remi was his mate, he was worried that Remi couldn't accept it.\n\nBut Remi is very attracted from Jake, all in Jake appeals him, scent, body and mind. Even the protective attitude of Jake is something that Remi finds reassuring and for the first time he thinks to be able to share with someone else his problems. Remi is out from an abusive father who now treats Remi's brother, Sterling, who is only 14 years old.\n\nRemi is a brave character, but he has not the force to face his father's brutality alone. He is for attitude and nature, a submissive: he needs the help, but over all the added force of his mate, Jake. And Jake is an alpha male, and a dominant character both in life then in sex. So he is the right mate for Remi.\n\nI have the strong feeling that Remi's character is changed a lot from the previous enstallment. In Without Reservation he is an interesting supporting character, but apart the physical beauty and a cocky attitude, no more else gave you the real impression of him. Instead he is a complex character, with a secret past which is a real twist in the actual story (no want to give off the story, so no hints on it).\n\nAs always the sex is a main aspect of the story and a strong point of force of it. It's masterly written, very arousing but not crude: J.L. Langley has the ability to get you excited (yes for real) without being graphic. Reading her sex scenes you have not the feeling to read an \"hot to do\" guide, and despite it, you are reading a good and explicit sex scene.\n\nLike in the other books in the series, the family (in the case of werewolf, the pack) is a main value: old good feelings and the idea that you are stronger if you lean on your pack. And they are also a great source for other stories in the series (I will look forward for Sterling and Rhys's story, and who will be Matt's mate?)\n\nWith Caution is a long book, more than 200 pages, but sure when you will arrive to the epilogue, you'd like to have more.", "Feedback": "positive"}

London, 1817\nIt's time for another meeting of the BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.\n\nRoss Benson is wealthy, titled, and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails.  He's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents.  The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.\n\nCassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country.  She detests crowds, couldn't care less about fashions, and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet.  She's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books.  The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.\n\nCassandra's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly weren't meant for a lady to hear.  The men are obviously inebriated but she doesn't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse.  When she opens the door to check on them, Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him.  They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he can't remember which guest room is his.  Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he doesn't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt.  From a maidenly point of view, that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake.  As she's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed, Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she can't deny him the request and soon doesn't want to deny him or the pleasures that they'll both find in his bed.  Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment?\n\nIN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This storyline is full of all the loveable characters, passion and suspense that I've come to eagerly anticipate about this series.  I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies.  She's extremely intelligent and honest, not to mention beautiful.  With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her.  Ross has been living the `privileged' lifestyle for so long he doesn't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra. There's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit, I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.\n\nWhile I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so won't detract from your enjoyment of them.\n\nChrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)", "Feedback": "positive"}

He is a jaded rake of a man, and the object of many women's fantasies.  He and Timothy Rollins are arriving back at Ivydale Manor, drunk, when they wake young Cassandra, Timothy's sister, who helps both men to bed.  When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.\n\nRoss is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.\n\nIn a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.\n\nScarlet\nreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed", "Feedback": "positive"}
